### Intro
When we last left our heroes, they were in the process of raiding a keep of some kind controlled by the Giant Decenters and [[King Snure]]. The party entered from the large southern egress, and found and freed a number of humanoids who had been enslaved by the giants here. After slaying the offending giantkin, and recruiting one of the enslaved - Mali-kana, of [[Macht's Orcs]], the party continued to explore the keep and found the Lady In White, [[Alylay Whitimore]], Matron of the Whitimore Drow and her two Concubines who barely escaped your grasp in the Underdark.
