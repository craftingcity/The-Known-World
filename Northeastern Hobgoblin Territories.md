This is the name for the region of the Known World that the hobgoblin clans that split from the psuedo-unified society that was beginning to form in the southeast. Although some of the other siblings of the #goblinoid family joined them, they are not credited in the name. 

This nation is organized by a single founding [[Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact|document]] that each member of the hobgoblin clans has signed over the years - or chosen to be destroyed.
