### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had travelled into the underground sewers of the Mossburg Garrison's Prison where they will attempt to kill the Captain of Imprisonment, and extract a particular prisoner back unto the surface. A local gangster, Jasper, is accompanying you, having led you through the stinking sewage to where you stand now, at a large iron grate that, once removed, will grant access into the Prison itself.

You can see beyond the grate, you will enter into an unoccupied maintenance room with one other entrance. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

The ingame date is 19th of Harvest (7), 106AF.

> **Operational Assignment**
> Enter the Prison under the Garrison. Locate and eliminate the Captain of Imprisonment. Locate Prisoner 6522 within Block B and escort them to the surface. Report your completion within 4 days.

The interior of the Prison is slightly damaged, primarily resulting in a semi-successful riot, splitting the prison. B Side, including the canteen, is controlled by the Prisoners, who have come to follow 'Rooter' as their leader, and A Side is controlled by the remaining Enforcers, and the Captain. 

The party will come into the "Working" Section of the Prison, and will face challenges as they navigate throughout.
