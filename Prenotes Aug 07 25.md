### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had been entrapped into the massive slab of amber they were transporting to the city of [[Goldfield]] after innocent investigation. Time broke, and you all became inside the gem, in rooms of glossy flowing amber and weirdly real constructions. Your instincts told you to fight, and so you began battle with these crystalline golems to find them very resilient - hard as rock. You have found claws of a dragon in the interior of these constructs, which slot into the table you found in another room. 

With adrenaline coursing through your veins, you continue to bludgeon, burn, and boil the amber creatures away - combat continues - the amber calls you deeper.

### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
