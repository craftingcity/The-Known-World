## Psionics
As a psion, you have mastered the ability to invoke the weave using nothing but your mind and will.
### Psionic Ability 
Your psionic ability is a representation of the entirety of your mind's ability. Average your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This is your "psionic ability score", and, using the typical modifer calculations, your Psionic Ability Modifier is determined by this score.

### Using Psionics
To use any psionic Disciplines, you must spend an amount of Effort equal to the Discipline's Effort Cost. You have a pool of Effort equal to your proficiency bonus plus your Psionic Ability Modifier. Some Disciplines require more time than others, but they all have some Action cost, as written in the Discipline.

At first level, you know two Disciplines of your choice that you meet the prerequisites for. After first level, you will gain one Discipline of your choice per level, and you may replace one Discipline you know with another you don't, but still meet the prerequisites for, at this time.

## Psionic Tradition
At third level, you choose a Psionic Tradition, shaping your mind to one purpose as you continue to practice psionics.

## Psionic Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain Disciplines that you can invoke them at will. 

Choose two Psionics of your choice that you know that have a Effort Cost of two or less. You may invoke these Disciplines without spending any Effort once each in between Rests. If you wish to invoke these Disciplines again, you may spend the normal Effort Cost to do so.

By spending 24 hours at Rest, you may change the Disciplines you selected for this feature.
