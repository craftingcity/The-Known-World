## Psionics
As a psion, you have mastered the ability to invoke the weave using nothing but your mind and will.
### Psionic Ability 
Your psionic ability is a representation of the entirety of your mind's ability. Average your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This is your "psionic ability score", and, using the typical modifer calculations, your Psionic Ability Modifier is determined by this score.

### Using Psionics
To use any psionic Disciplines, you must spend an amount of Effort equal to the Discipline's Effort Cost. You have a pool of Effort (or, *ki*,) equal to your proficiency bonus plus your Psionic Ability Modifier. All Disciplines require some amount of time, meaning they all have some Action cost, as written in the Discipline.

At first level, you know a Disciplines of your choice that you meet the prerequisites for. After first level, you will gain one Discipline of your choice every other level, and you may replace one Discipline you know with another you don't, but still meet the prerequisites for, at this time.

## Psionic Mastery
