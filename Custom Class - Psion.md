### Psionic Ability 
Your psionic ability is a representation of the entirety of your mind's ability. Average your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This is your "psionic ability score", and, using the typical modifer calculations, your Psionic Ability Modifier is determined by this score.

### Using Psionics
To use any psionic Disciplines, you must spend an amount of Effort equal to the Discipline's Effort Cost. You have a pool of Effort equal to your proficiency bonus plus your Psionic Ability Modifier.
