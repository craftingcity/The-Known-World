### Reagent Points
The Reagent Points column of the Alchemist table shows you how many Reagent Points you have to use your features. You regain all expended Reagent Points when you finish a long rest. 

### Concoct: Elixir
At 1st level, as an Attack, you throw an Elixir. Expend one Reagent Point and roll a d6 on the Elixir Effect Table. Then, choose a point within 30ft of you where the Elixir will land.

| 5   | *Eruption* - Within a 5ft radius of the point, grey earth fills the radius, creating a 5ft raised surface within the radius.                                                                      |

### Infuse Trinket
At 2nd level, as a Bonus Action, you may expend a number of Reagent Points to infuse a small item or object with your choice of an Infusion from the Infusion Table. The item or object remains Infused until it is used, or you finish a long rest.

| Cost | Effect                                                                                                                                                               |

| 2    | *Operative* - When you next make a Initiative Roll, you expend the Infusion and gain +2 to the result.                                                               |
| 3    | *Competitive* - When you next Hit on an Attack, you expend the Infusion and roll twice for the Damage you deal, taking the higher total result.                      |

### Mobile Laboratory
At 3rd level, during a long rest, you may modify a mobile space (such as a cart or a room on a ship) you occupy with secured alchemical facilities. 

At 3rd level, your Mobile Laboratory grants you the following effects;

- While your Laboratory is accessible, when you finish a short rest, you may regain Reagent Points by spending an Alchemical Component valued at 5sp or more. The number of Reagent Points you regain is equal to one-fifth the value of the Alchemical component spent, rounded down.
- While your Laboratory is accessible, when you finish a long rest, you may assign your Mobile Laboratory an Alchemical Recipe that you know. When you do, you spend the Alchemical Components required for that recipe, and your Laboratory begins performing the processes of that Recipe. When you next finish a long rest while your Laboratory is accessible, you gather one unit of the Alchemical Product of that Recipe, and may re-assign your Laboratory.
	- During the Grading of a product, your Mobile Laboratory will use your number of Alchemist levels as the result of its die roll, and your choice of your Arcana or Survival Skills.
	- You may still use your Laboratory as normal while it is performing an assignment.

At 9th level, your Mobile Laboratory grants you the following additional effects;

- When you would gather an Alchemical Product from your Mobile Laboratory, you gather two units instead of one.
- While your Laboratory is accessible, when you finish a long rest, you may assign your Mobile Laboratory an Alchemical Product that you own. When you do, you destroy the Alchemical Product and your Laboratory begins scribing the Alchemical Recipe used to create that Product. When you next finish a long rest while your Laboratory is accessible, you gather the Alchemical Recipe of that Product, and may re-assign your Laboratory.


At 15th level, your Mobile Laboratory grants you the following additional effects;

- 

### Extra Attack
At 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Concoct: Powderblast
At 6th level, as an Attack, you throw a Powderblast. Spend two Reagent Points and roll a d6 on the Powderblast Effect Table. Then, choose a point within 20ft of you where the Powderblast will disperse.

| d6  | Effect |
| --- | ------ |
| 1   |        |
| 2   |        |
| 3   |        |

### Reliable Concoctions
At 7th level, when you use a Concoct feature, you may roll twice for the Effect, and choose one.

### Emergency Prevention and Care
At 10th level, as a Bonus Action, you may spend any number of Reagent Points and choose that many creatures that can you can see within 60ft. When you do, those creatures immediately make a Saving Throw against an Effect or Condition they are inflicted with.

### Concoct: Pharmaceutical
At 11th level, as an Attack, you fire a Pharmaceutical. Spend three Reagent Points and roll a d6 on the Pharmaceutical Effect Table. Then, choose a creature you can see within 60ft
