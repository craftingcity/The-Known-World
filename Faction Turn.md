## Reactions / Post-Main
## Results / Cleanup
### Guilds of Coalition
> The guilds have been hard at work preparing secure border-posts throughout Alaturmen, and with the assistance of others, their goal was quickly completed. The Ranger's Guild is standing tall, refortified after the largest breach of the Wildland Border that any on Alaturmen had seen.

### Kingdom of Prosper
> By order of the King, his court wizard heads a project to more easily distribute magic among his people. As one does, she replied that it could be done. With a flash of inspiration, she began to have an inkling of a beginning of a practical concept.

### Church of the White Flame
> A large caravan of Suremantle Traders was waylaid with religious posterization and completely failed to make sales due to what the locals called a "titherraf", some combination of religious conviction and governmental decree. In any case, this caravan returned home with all they left with other than their rations, time, and dignity.

### Golden Claws
> Throughout the southern regions of the Deserts of Tetrimoc, small groups of Cobalt's Thieves have been killed, a foul-play of wyvern and steel. It makes one wonder who possibly could have done such a thing...
