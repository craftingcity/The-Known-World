> I live in a place of many Wonders. The lands shift before our eyes rather than behind our backs. I doubt you would believe it nearly as beautiful as our beach, but I believe this to be the truth. There are others here, the goblins as you said, but others too! It has been truly wonderful. I hope to return to you soon.

## The World is Young
In the beginning, many things happened at once.

The goblins have been, are, and always will be everywhere. They swam in the soup of Alaturmen before it was a glint in any power's eye.

The Immortal Dragons were there too, swimming alongside, creating and destroying as they wished. They became bored of their power. Among themselves, they agreed to become cursed with the one thing they could not control: time. They fell upon the planes and created mortality. Among them, the Yellow Dragon Tetrimoc fell to Alaturmen. 

In the planes that were before time was, the Feywild's Eladrin made their progeny; onnonyamile - child of my parent - elves. It was the Eladrin's claim that the Elves were the true heirs of Alaturmen, that it was made for *their* children.

Quickly, these claims had no power, for **mortality** would claim all in Alaturmen, pardoning its Gods, and the people who came to be began to come together.

## Geography

At the edge of the land, the common folk will tell you to venture no further. They are right to warn you. Some magic breathes in this world. The Weave grows and shrinks the world to its whims. When people go too far, they do not come back. Unless you speak of [[Eladrithal Greystone]], but that is another tale.

### Northeast
The northeast is a temperate forest. This is the area that is least separated by its neighbors, and as such, has become a powerful area to control. Currently, it is contested by [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] and the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories]].

### Northwest
The northwest was a temperate forest, and is now a unique ashen ecosystem (see Morrowind?).

### Southwest
The southwest is a desert. This is the land that Tetrimoc made his home, although the people now rule these lands. He is a religious figure to most here, rather than a mortal dragon as he is.

### Southeast
The southeast is a series of wet and warm areas. This makes much of the land swampy and wet. Incredibly, this has created an abundance of food and livable area here, as the people who came to live here developed technologies that took great advantage of their surroundings.

All of what is considered "the southeast" is controlled by members of the [[Democratic Combine of Peoples]]
