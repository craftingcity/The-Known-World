> I live in a place of many Wonders. The lands shift before our eyes rather than behind our backs. I doubt you would believe it nearly as beautiful as our beach, but I believe this to be the truth. There are others here, the goblins as you said, but others too! It has been truly wonderful. I hope to return to you soon.

## The World is Young
In the beginning, many things happened at once.

The goblins have been, are, and always will be everywhere. They swam in the soup of Alaturmen before it was a glint in any power's eye.

The Immortal Dragons were there too, swimming alongside, creating and destroying as they wished. They became bored of their power. Among themselves, they agreed to become cursed with the one thing they could not control: time. They fell upon the planes and created mortality. Among them, the Yellow Dragon Tetrimoc fell to Alaturmen.
