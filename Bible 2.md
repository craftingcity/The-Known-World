> I live in a place of many Wonders. The lands shift before our eyes rather than behind our backs. I doubt you would believe it nearly as beautiful as our beach, but I believe this to be the truth. There are others here, the goblins as you said, but others too! It has been truly wonderful. I hope to return to you soon.
> \- [[Eladrithal Greystone]] to his parents

## The World is Young
In the beginning, many things happened at once.

The goblins have been, are, and always will be everywhere. They swam in the soup of Alaturmen before it was a glint in any power's eye.

The Immortal Dragons were there too, swimming alongside, creating and destroying as they wished. They became bored of their power. Among themselves, they agreed to become cursed with the one thing they could not control: time. They fell upon the planes and created mortality. Among them, the Yellow Dragon Tetrimoc fell to Alaturmen. 

In the planes that were before time was, the Feywild's Eladrin made their progeny; ***onnonyamile***; *child of my parent*; the elves. It was the Eladrin's claim that the Elves were the true heirs of Alaturmen, that it was made for *their* children, and this was what they told their children.

Quickly, these claims had no power, for **mortality** would claim all in Alaturmen, pardoning its Gods, and the people who came to be began to come together.

## Geography

At the edge of the land, the common folk will tell you to venture no further. They are right to warn you. Some magic breathes in this world. The Weave grows and shrinks the world to its whims. When people go too far, they do not come back. Unless you speak of [[Eladrithal Greystone]], but that is another tale.

### Northeast
The northeast is a temperate forest. This is the area that is least separated by its neighbors, and as such, has become a powerful area to control. Currently, it is contested by [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] and the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories]].

### Northwest
The northwest was a temperate forest, and is now a unique ashen ecosystem (see Morrowind?). This area is seperated from its neighbors by a large burn line in the east and the [[Deakred Range]] at its south. Currently, it is nearly entirely controlled by [[The Church of the White Flame]].

### Southwest
The southwest is a desert. This is the land that Tetrimoc made his home, although the people now rule these lands. He is a religious figure to most here, rather than a mortal dragon as he is. This area is seperated from its neighbors by the [[Deakred Range]] at its north and the [[Alavini River]] at its east.

### Southeast
The southeast is a series of wet and warm areas. This makes much of the land swampy and wet. Incredibly, this has created an abundance of food and livable area here, as the people who came to live here developed technologies that took great advantage of their surroundings.

All of what is considered "the southeast" is controlled by members of the [[Democratic Combine of Peoples]]. Each member controls their own territory, and is encouraged to fight with their peers for the power they hold, but when the Combine is under threat, all quarrels are halted for the common good of the Peoples.

### Coalition City
In the direct center of [[Central Alaturmen]] and the large cup-end of the [[Deakred Range]] stands [[Coalition City]]. A testament to the ideal of community that is inherent in these people. It is controlled by the [[Guilds]]. Members thereof are often regarded in authority, no matter their current location.

### "Non-Nation Entities"
#### Cenva Minyo
The Winter Elf Remnants, [[Cenva Minyo]], gather and grow just south of the Actstow Hills, waiting for their moment to enact revenge for their fallen in the [[Great Fires]].

#### Dwarven Kingdom Actstow
The [[Dwarven Kingdom Actstow]] is a beating heart of dwarven industrialism. The dwarves here are carved from hill stone, and they have shown grace and honor in the face of uncertainty.

#### Dwarven Kingdom Suremantle
The Mountain Hall is claimed by the [[Dwarven Kingdom Suremantle]] as the ancestral home of the Suremantle clan. The Suremantles gathered strength and secured alliances, but knew that a dwarves' heart belongs to his family first, and remain minor isolationists.

## People
Most people use barter to trade for resources, as most people do not carry minted coin, but coin and merchant bar is acceptable currency nearly anywhere. The Kingdom of Prosper has a large treasury, and has spread coin around the world, making it the dominant currency, but each of the "nations" of the world mint their own coin.

The most common working job is that of the Farmer. The second most common is that of the Defender. The third, the Plunderer.

The people of the world have [[The Worldwide Calander Systems|different names]] for the days of the week and months of the year, but they all use a 7 day week and a 52 week year.

The most common languages spoken - and therefore the common humanoid trade languages - are [[Desertspeech]], [[High Common]], [[King's Common]], and [[Swampish]]. They are all born of the languages of the humans mixed with great influence from the historical languages of the dragons, elves, goblin, and triton respectively.

## Power
The quickest path to power is by the manipulation of the Weave. Mages are respected and often feared.

Secondarily, many gain power by learning from their elders, peers, and the materials of the past. Two of three people develop the ability to read.

Finally, of course, many people gain power from physical force; more weaponry, people, or efficiency
