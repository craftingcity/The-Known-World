# Lorem (City)
The last stop in [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]] before [[Coalition City]], meaning it is a important city to hold as the main decider of who gets first representation. Currently the city is uncontested by any faction, and is making attempts to create a "Township Alliance" with the other Northwestern cities so that they can absolve themselves from the race (and always win first slot).
