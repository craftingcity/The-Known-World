# Kickoff (City)
Kickoff's main industry is mining and exporting dylithium crystal, a powerful arcanic component and beautiful clear crystal that is most commonly used in the focusing of raw elemental magic. The way that the crystal resonates with the [Weave Potentia](simplenote://note/6133d992-3642-4b4d-bbb8-2bb9c3abb0e5) creates a direct line into the elemental planes, and artificers have recently ([130 AF](simplenote://note/c2cd3ccd-425a-42ff-bd54-d8863c19813c)) manufactured certain weapons that use this powerful leyline to fire small pellets and rocks over long distances.
