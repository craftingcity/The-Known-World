# Description
Kickoff's main industry is mining and exporting durandurm crystal, a powerful magical component; beautiful clear crystal that is most commonly used in the focusing of raw elemental magic. 

The way that the crystal resonates with the Weave creates a direct line into the elemental planes, and artificers have recently ([[Prime Timeline#The Second Age The Age of Wonder]]) manufactured certain weapons that use this powerful leyline to fire small pellets and rocks over long distances.

## Defenses
Kickoff is one of the few holdings in [[The Outlands]] that is not under [[The Outlands#Thieves|a team of thieves']] control.

Given that they are located in between [[Agrandica]]'s and [[Barthalmule]]'s area of control, they often make attempts to gain control of the town. They are never fully successful, as they are contended by the other of the two whenever they attempt.
