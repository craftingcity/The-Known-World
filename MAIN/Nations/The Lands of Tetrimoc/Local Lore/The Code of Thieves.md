I am a thief. This means that I will...
Respect my fellows.
Respect my marks.
Respect my tools.


I fight for my own, and for our families.
They shall eat before we shall eat.

I will not kill.
The value of life is above any coin.

My weapon is my livelihood.
There is nothing that will separate our bond.
