# Tetrimoc's Journal

This is the content of [[Tetrimoc]]'s journal.

> A large tome, manifested by pure draconic radiation, bound in golden dragonhide and silver looping. It adorns no markings on its surface. Collections of notes and pages have been added to this journal over the unknowable years of its use, and all but the most recent pages have yellowed with age.

#### Year 0
I have landed here. I am injured. My tome has manifested with me as I fell. I shall rest for some time and heal my wounds. I shall dig into the desert.

#### Year 2
My lair is car

#### Year 25
It is beginning to fall. The nights are colder now. My body is healed, and my lair is crafted. I have seen some bipedal creatures since my fall, although they have yet to accomplish anything of note. Perhaps I will make them.

#### Year 31
The creatures gather around my cave in grand numbers. They call themselves "people". Some speak of [[50 Year Fires|a great fire]]. They ask me for protection. They more often protect themselves, but I agree to this contract. A small boon from each of these ones. Tasty.

#### Year 50
My peoples are crafting a grand settlement around my lair. They worship me as a god. They should, I am as close as many of them will get. The cut I sustained during my fall was upon the mountain of [[Kailkeep]]. The Kobolds there do not listen to me, I waited too long to claim them as my own. They have harbored many evils since my reawakening. I will keep them stagnant.

#### Year 72
A people from a far land came to me. They spoke of [[Arthur Simonson|a king]]. I spoke of my power. More communication to ensue. I do not wish to speak to these people. Perhaps I will make my people work instead. Not yet, this still requires my attention.

#### Year 76
I spoke with many of the peoples in recency. Annoying, but fruitful. I brought with me a band of mine, representing the whole of my flock. We spoke of peace, teamwork, growth. A fine trade; stay out of my scales and I will not smite you. The peoples agreed. They will build [[Coalition City|a city]] in this honor.

#### Year 88
A group of people, [[The Grey Ordeal]], came to me seeking aid. A fight with a great demon. One was of my flock. I granted this boon. Many items were distributed, and they will be returned in fold. 

#### Year 94
I am tired. I have written for many years.
