## The Lands of Tetrimoc

### Government of [[The Golden City]]
While many in the Golden City claim that all of the desert is ruled by [[Tetrimoc]], he has grown complacent (or simply bored), and leaves the Outlanders to themselves. Tetrimoc apparently controls the immediate area around the Golden City, and the Outlanders control the rest of the Desert, but it has been [[Prime Timeline|a few years]] since Tetrimoc has been seen in the city.

Tetrimoc rules with a golden claw; much like an iron fist, but more benevolent and more ruthless. His followers are much the same. [[The Golden City]] is a safe place to be, as it is protected by the [[Golden Claws]], but those who protect also enforce. They are called "Claws" for a reason.

### Government of [[The Outlands]]
The Outlanders follow a loose [[The Code of Thieves|"Theives' Code"]] that allows them to "play the game", as they say. Killing another is generally disrespected, and it is your duty as an Outlander to "call your hits", meaning to surrender and retreat under overwhelming pressure. The weapons **(import paper notes on this)** that the Outlanders use are generally nonlethal, dealing force damage, and long range; similar to what you or I may think of as a [pellet gun](https://www.evike.com/).

Three "teams" of thieves have become very well established, and fight against each other and the four or more nomadic collectives for the few and far between resources in the desert. The "teams" are each named after and headed by a "team captain" who has proven themself in their own way. Currently, the three teams are lead by [[Agrandica]], [[Barthalmule]], and [[Cobalt]].

Food, water, and medicine are primary concerns, while ammunition and weaponry are secondary. There is little metal mined or refined in these lands, so what little metal there is is generally imported and poor quality. This means that combat is generally a ranged and poorly armored affair. 

### The Tournament
While the Thieves are often left to their own devices, [[The Golden City]] hosts [[Tetrimoc's Tournament of Glory]] for the most affluent class to spectate. Many Thieves come and fight for sport here, and a Thief that wins is given glorious treasure; this bounty is always enough to move the winners and their family many many classes above where they were before. This is supposedly sponsored by [[Tetrimoc]]'s horde.

### Population Distribution and Language
The desert's common is largely based on the languages of Dragons and Gnolls; draconic and abyssal respectively. This language is called [[Desertspeech]].

Population distribution is as follows; one may...
- commonly find the "races of men", such as human, halflings, dwarves
- commonly find the "monstrous races", such as gnoll, bugbear, goblin
- uncommonly find elven folk
- uncommonly find the "exotic races" such as dragonborn, goliaths, tiefling, kenku
