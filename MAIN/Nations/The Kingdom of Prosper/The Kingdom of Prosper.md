# The Kingdom of Prosper
Not but 45 years have passed since the [[Arthur Simonson|Great Adverturer King]] united the lands. The city of [[Yerba]] is the largest city in the Kingdom, second only to the [[Castle Prosper]] and its surrounding municipality. Many other small collectives blot the land (such as the farming community of [[Moonlight]]), connected by poorly kempt cobbled roads. Much of the geography of Prosper is forested. 

## History
In [[Prime Timeline|70AF]], [[Arthur Simonson]] united the lands now known as the Kingdom of Prosper by force and popular demand. This is known as the [[Unification]]. He gave a much needed structure to the peoples of Prosper and directly opposed the exploitative forces that previously occupied the area (such as [[The Arstoviches]]).

In [[Prime Timeline|128AF]], the local Hobgoblin population erupted into civil war. [[The Hobgoblin Wars]] have yet to be resolved and have created a massive issue for Artie and the rest of the government.

## Government
The Kingdom of Prosper is a monarchy, headed by the great [[Arthur Simonson]], and enforced by his standing army.

## Population Distribution and Language
The common language in Prosper is known as "the [[King's Common]]" and is based majorly on the languages of Humans and Elves. 

Population distribution is as follows; one may...
- large swaths of the "races of men", such as humans, halflings, dwarves
- large swaths of elves
- commonly find the "monstrous races", such as gnoll, bugbear, goblin
- rarely the "exotic races" such as dragonborn, goliaths, tiefling, kenku, triton
- rarely feyborn, such as eladrin
