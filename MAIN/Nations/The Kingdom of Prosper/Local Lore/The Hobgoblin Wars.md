The [[Hobgoblin Specifics|Hobgoblin]] Wars begin in [[Prime Timeline|109AF]] with the assassination of Drubulek [[Tigbulg Wheernat]] of the [[Wheernat Clan]] by a young up-an-coming Mangugu: [[Qiurkik Scrivin]] of the [[Scrivin Clan]]. This disrupted the power structure of the Wheernat Clan, leaving their defenses open, and inciting war between the two clans and the neighboring [[Bulgpim Clan]], who is using the opportunity to take land and resources.
