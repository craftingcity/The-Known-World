# The Church of the White Flame

The [[#The Church of the White Flame]] is the main body of government in the [[The Holy'lnds]], as a caste theocracy. They worship [[Its Greatness]] as a great force to be revered for its allowance of containment. 

## Castes
Ranking from highest in verticality and station:
- Spoken (the few who draw holy power from White Flame)
- Firstchurch (highpreist, only based in the Holy City of Kanielkiln)
- Tendered (a priest of the Church, tended by a Firstchurch)
- Patron
- Unseen
- (undesirable)

## The Formal Journey
The Tendered are a preist class in the society of [[The Holy'lnds]]. They are taken at a young age to [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]] and raised by the Firstchurch. When they are ready, they begin their formal journey; They are ordaned in filigry by their Firstchurch and acend the 100 steps into the White Church. They are to be greeted by the Spoken of the church and given their flame. They then depart from the city in parade and glory. They will carry with them their flame where they go and tend it. Many start churches of their own and grow the flock of Patrons from the Unseen. Some settle otherwise, starting businesses, charities, or other orginizations.

## The Truth
 > "The Great White Flame is not a "god". When The Great Flame made armageddon of our holyl'nd many perished as non-believers. We are not fools. " - Gimish, of Firstchurch
