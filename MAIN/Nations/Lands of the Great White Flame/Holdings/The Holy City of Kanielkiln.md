# The Holy City of Kanielkiln

A vast tiered city in the [[The Holy'lnds|Lands of the Great White Flame]] the top of which holds in reverence the Blackened Brazier, in which The Great White Flame resides. This is the flame from which all other tendered flames are lit, and the others from these. The tiers of the city loosely follow the [[The Church of the White Flame#Castes|Castes System]].

In the inner ring of the city the top three castes intermingle. This is the Scamall District. Wide homes of grey holyl'nd and large open spaces of gathering, common, and collaboration. Many of the youngest Tendered reside here under the guidance of the Firstchurch before outgrowing the tutelage and beginning their formal journey. In its glory, the White Church stands above the rest of the city by 100 steps of holyl'nd. The White Church is off limits to Tendered under all conditions sans the beginning of their formal journey. 

In the outer ring of the city, some Tendered make their home here among the Patrons of the city. Small squished places of residence, commerce, or craft built of burnt wood and flood this large outer ring of the city.

Outside the walls of the city, many of the Unseen make their permanency. These folk are workers and pay their Tendered in exchange for its Greatness' tolerance.
