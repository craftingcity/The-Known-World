# The Holy City of Kanielkiln

A vast tiered city in the [[The Holy'lnds|Lands of the Great White Flame]] the top of which holds in reverance the Blackened Brazzier, in which The Great White Flame resides. This is the flame from which all other tendered flames are lit, and the others from these. The teirs of the city loosley follow the [[The Church of the White Flame#Castes|Castes]] System

In the inner ring of the city the top three castes intermingle. This is the Scamall District. Wide homes of holyl'nd and large spaces of gathering, common, and collaberation. Many of the youngest Tendered reside here under the guidence of the Firstchurch before outgrowing the tutilage and begining their formal journey. In its glory, the White Church stands above the rest of the city by 100 steps of holyl'nd. The Whitechurch is off limits to Tendered under all conditions sans the beginning of their formal journey. 

At the second teir of the city, some Tendered make their home here among the Patrons of the city. Small squished places of residence, commerce, or craft flood this large outer ring of the city.

Outside the walls of the city, many of the Unseen make their perminancy. These folk are workers and pay their Tendered in exchange for its Greatness' tollerance.
