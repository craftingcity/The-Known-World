The lands of [[Its Greatness]]...

![[The Holyl'nds.png]]

An arid and barren land, buildings made of ash-clay. Many grand cities are built in this land, and the once wasteland is made glorious by grey-brown cities on black ash holyl'nd and burned soil.

# Holyl'nd
Holyl'nd is the name of this place, the space of this area, and a material unique to this place. 

The material holyl'nd is a unique substance composed of the ash of wood burned by [[Its Greatness]], the clay of this land, and water. Formed and set to dry, it quickly forms solid bricks of great strength but light weight. Few have managed it, the dwarf [[Tuburic Millstone Wrinsmith]] among them, but a composite alloy of holyl'nd and mythril can be formed and worked under [[Its Greatness]] to forge items of powerfully divine make.


## Government
This land is formally and culturally controlled by [[The Church of the White Flame]]. They currently face very little internal resistance. They are being externally resisted against by [[The Whitimores]] as of [[Prime Timeline|XX AF]]

## Population Distribution
The general population of the Holyl'nds is as follows;
- large swaths of elven folk
- large swaths of orcs and half-orcs
- commonly find humans, haflings, and other "races of men"
- rarely find "exotic races" such as dragonborn, gnolls, lizardfolk, goliath

## Cities and Towns, But not Hamlets
The largest city in this nation is [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]]. Others include [[Yagil]], Prag, Kraushaar, [[Monahish]], Danila, Odaya, Kohnstamm, Sansonlevy, Baskin, and Gilyr. The land here is not fruitful but in small areas. These areas have cities in them. They are marked on the map. Very few people survive with any permanance outside of a [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]] city.

### A Mystery
Untouched by [[Its Greatness]], a set of ruins that the people simply call [[The Old]] lies on fresh grass. This set of ruins is massive, competing in size with [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]]. The few expeditions that have entered and returned have revealed nothing of interest but report that they feel like they were watched the whole time. This feeling does not dissipate for the rest of their lives, many of these explorers went insane later in their lives.

## Important Symbolism
#### The Flame
Usually embossed on the [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]]'s holy warrior's armor or worn as a amulet, pendant, or otherwise kept, a simple design of a 6
