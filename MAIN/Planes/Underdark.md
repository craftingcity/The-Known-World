# Structure
The Underdark is known for two sections; the shallows and the deep. The shallows and the deep mix like anything else in the worlds. The features of this place change, and over the weeks and months, the rock breathes and moves.

The rock of this place is featured; Darkrock drinks in the light of the place, both sources natural and otherwise, Glowstone does the opposite, providing the light by which many creatures live, Wormrock is a nutritional boon to the creatures here, as its collection process is easy and benifitial to those who would stomach the taste, and Bloodrock makes the tunnels of this place, and the fights in the tunnels are most brutal.

# King's Highway
The tunnels were the screams of a tortured god, Torog, whom is believed to have finally died. Now Lolth is the Queen of the Underdark, and drow, mindflayer and other factions vie for the throne.

The "King's Highway" is the largest and most permanent tunnels through this plane. The blood of Torog gives magic to it. Crusted blood and puss fill the gouges against the walls and the tunnels themselves. Ranging from 50 to 200 feet in diameter, they are the quickest and most dangerous path through the underdark.

# Threats
Drow make their home in the deep sections of the underdark, and make cities and townships in which to live. 

Their far cousins, the Duergar, work the stone of this plane as the dwarves do above, but have little care for the honor and companionship of traditional dwarven families. Carved from the rock of the Deep, Duergar take slaves to mine for them and to eat.

Unnatural oozes and mushrooms make their home in the tunnels and dark forests of this place. These "natural threats" are tended by Troglodytes who grow their food and scavenge what they can from others.

Aberrations like Grik, Beholder, etc. come from the Spawning Fields. The Mind Flayers come from there too, but make their homes in the deeper dungeons and ruins that are scattered around this plane.

Dragons make their homes here too. 

# History
Dwarves held a city here once; Deepreach. It fell long ago. Now the communities of dwarves here are secretive, and are of those who "mine too deep".

Few communities of humans live in the underdark, and those that do are no longer truly human. Madness and adaption has led even the people of "Refuge" to become something other; translucent skin, light hair, wiry frames from eating the moss and mud and rock. "Refuge" is guarded by a group of cursed adventurers that turn to and from stone, only defending when absolutely necessary.
