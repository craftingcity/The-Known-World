The Underdark is known for two sections; the shallows and the deep. The shallows and the deep mix like anything else in the worlds. The features of this place change, and over the weeks and months, the rock breathes and moves.

The rock of this place is featured; Darkrock drinks in the light of the place, both sources natural and otherwise, Glowstone does the opposite, providing the light by which many creatures live, Wormrock is a nutritional boon to the creatures here, as its collection process is easy and benifitial to those who would stomach the taste, and Bloodrock makes the tunnels of this place, and the fights in the tunnels are most brutal.

Drow make their home in the deep, and aberrations come forth from below. 

The tunnels were the screams of a tortured god, Torog, whom is believed to have finally died. Now Lolth is the Queen of the Underdark, and factions vie for the throne.
