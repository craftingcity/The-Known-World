# The Great Adventurer King, Arthur Simonson

An eternally young (as graced by some manipulation of the Weave) adventurer king. He holds many titles, which [[Balthazar Wumfingle|his attendant]] refuses not to say, but prefers to be known to his friends as Artie.

He is happy to work with known adventurers and has many liaison to the adventurers guild to keep an eye on new talent and interesting plots.

Artie just sort of "fell into" becoming the King of [[The Kingdom of Prosper|Prosper]]; As a youngling, he saw the horrors of the uncivilized world. He used this to fuel his passion for adventure and when he came of age, he liberated the many holdings in the [[The Kingdom of Prosper|northeast]]. These holdings heralded him as their savior and, needing new management, he became their King.

Arthur lives in his holding, [[Castle Prosper]], with his lovers. Long ago, he lived with the remaining members of [[Simonson's Adventuring Party|his adventuring party]], but they are since dead of old age or otherwise.
