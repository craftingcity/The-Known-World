# The Great Adventurer King, Arthur Simonson

> A tall half-hobgoblin-human man with dark curly hair and brown skin. He wears a set of leather armor underneath a large blue royal coat. Atop his head sits a platinum circlet spiked with gold.

Arthur is an un-aging adventurer king. He holds many [[#Titles]], which [[Balthazar Wumfingle|his attendant]] refuses not to say, but prefers to be known to his friends as Artie.

He is happy to work with known adventurers and has many liaison to the adventurers guild to keep an eye on new talent and interesting plots.

## History

Artie just sort of "fell into" becoming the King of [[The Kingdom of Prosper|Prosper]]; As a youngling, he saw the horrors of the uncivilized world. He used this to fuel his passion for adventure and when he came of age, he liberated the many holdings in the [[The Kingdom of Prosper|northeast]]. These holdings heralded him as their savior and, needing new management, he became their King.

He sent expeditions out to many locations across the land, including [[The Old]] and [[Kailkeep]]. Because of these expeditions, he was cited many times for abuse by the [[Guild of Adventurers]], and as such has poor standing with them. 

## Location
Arthur lives in his holding, [[Castle Prosper]], with his lovers. Long ago, he lived with the remaining members of [[Simonson's Adventuring Party|his adventuring party]], but they are since dead of old age or otherwise.

## Statistics
Arthur is, at base, a CR 9 ["Champion Warrior"](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/npc/champion-warrior/). His weapons is a *longsword +3*. He wears a *belt of unnatural strength* that sets his Strength to 24, and a *ring of mind shielding* that houses no other soul and is kept invisible unless otherwise stated. His curse provides him with the mechanical effects of a *ring of regeneration*.

He wears a signet ring that bares the [[Seal of Kingdom Prosper]]. His "Novum Caput Dei" is a circlet made of a band of platinum and gold and is politically invaluable, but could theoretically be sold for some 1,500 pp.
