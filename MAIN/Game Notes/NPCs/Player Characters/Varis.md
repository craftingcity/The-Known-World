We do not know his lineage {This is a lie, we do. He is firstborn of [[Vhaeraun]]}. He was adopted by [[Amashod]]'s parents. He was called Nostarenca before his adulthood. Varis was captured by [[House Thoulca]] and brought to the [[The Planes of Existence#The Underdark]]. He began to learn magic, and "got an in" with a servant of the house, the gardener. He and his partner [[Travis]] made plans to escape. They worked with the gardener and scoped out the layout of the stronghold. Eventually they found the a crack in the walls, which they swiftly covered with illusion magic, and Varis made a gambit; one night, the two of them were in their cell, it was bedtime. They were supposed to be going to sleep. Varis had spent about a year for this. "Whatever's beyond the garden wall is better than this".
