# CURRENT NOTES

I want to make the lore of my world cool and interactive. [[Historical Markings]] on weapons, armor, and other items of importance or value such as coins or paintings are a great idea. #npc characters should make passing remarks about #loreful happenings and characters. Firsthand #text accounts are useful to flesh out these ideas, but cannot be the only way the lore is delivered. Ideally, the story we tell at the table aligns with the story I tell you about this world, and the characters and groups our players interact with should interact with the lore as well. Given that this is a living document, and one that is quite young, we are only at the beginning stages of that idea.

What if [[Kakurak]] died and turned into a lich's pet?


# NEXT SESSION

[[Kakurak]] requests of the adventures that they walk [[The Planes of Existence]] without a return ticket, under the assumption that the fire giants would have some way of transporting themselves here. [[Kakurak]] admits to the adventurers that this is an extremely dangerous request, and he would not hold it against them should they refuse.

In either case, [[The Whitimores]] have plans for these meddling adventurers; a strike team has caught wind of their plans to stop the giants and will follow the adventurers for over a day before attacking at the most opportune time. It is their goal to capture them and bring them to the bowels of the [[The Planes of Existence#The Underdark]] where they are to be jailed ad infinitum as examples of futility in resisting the will of the Whitimore Drow. This should be a deadly encounter. 

This means we need to prepare a few encounters;
- [ ] walking the planes (see [[Planeswalking toward Fire]])
- [ ] arriving in the plane of fire
- [x] the Whitimore first encounter (see [[The Varis Hit]])
- [ ] the Whitimore compound
- [x] [[King Snure]]'s compound
- [ ] Snure's Raiding force
