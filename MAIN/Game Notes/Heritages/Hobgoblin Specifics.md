Hobgoblins are a #goblinoid race. This means a few things;
- They have a legitimate claim to being "here first", given that humans and elves and dwarves "came" here when [[Tetrimoc]] fell.
- They are born of planscape; giving and begetting thing one
- They are sibling to the other two #goblinoid races

# Who Are the Hobgoblins?
The Hobgoblins are a big brother to the [[Goblin Specifics|Goblin]], and little brother to the [[Bugbear Specifics|Bugbear]]. They used to share the world as  a family, but since the "persons" came, the #goblinoid races have seen the lesser in eachother, and often look down upon their siblings; They work together often, however, and are a good team. The Hobgoblins are the smartest of the group, by a margin, and when isolated as a group or singularly, they are quite militaristic and imperial. Their [[Goblin Specifics|little siblings]] can often convince them to see the fun in living for something other than military honor, and they can convince their [[Bugbear Specifics|older siblings]] to think less often of here and now. As stated, they work together well as a team.

# Hobgoblin Clans
Hobgoblin clans hold themselves to an ancient system of honors: the [[Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact]]. This rewards imperialism, eldership, biting those your lesser, proving your worth, competition, etc. The many Hobgoblin Clans are often at war with the races of "persons" in the area or eachother, and fiercely defend their territory. 

# Some Fun Facts
- Hobgoblins and Humans cannot have children, or at least couldn't until [[Arthur Simonson|Arthur]]
- some of the northern [[#Hobgoblin Clans]] are at war.
