# Prime's Grand Timeline

## The Age of Beginning
The recorded history begins with [[Tetrimoc's Journal]].
```timeline-labeled
date: 000AF
title: The Fall
content: 

[[Tetrimoc]] falls, the timeline begins. The #goblinoid people have been here for as long as they can remember.

date: 

date: 025AF
title: A long Wait
content:

Tetrimoc fully recovers, settlements are beginning to form and nations history generally begins here. [[Its Greatness]] starts the [[50 Year Fires]] in the [[The Holy'lnds|northwest]]. Little happens in the worldwide lens until the nations are fully formed. See [[Tetrimoc's Journal]] for a firsthand veiw of these long waiting years.



date: 073AF
title: Nations Born
content:

Nations are clear now. The [[50 Year Fires]] have ended and the [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]] has taken control of the northwest. The [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]] is ratified, and its internal power struggle (see [[Combine's Great Wars]]) begins. With [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] becoming an imperial powerhouse in the northeast, small skirmishes between the Combine and Prosper leads to a minor war.

date: 078AF
title: The Coalition is Formed
content:

A "common" language has been formed. [[The Grey Ordeal]] unite the nations for peace and cooperation given the limited resources available. A city is created in the center of the nations under the (perhaps inumaginitive) name [[Coalition City]]. For the next decade, this is where the nations struggle for power. [[The Guilds]] make sure nothing gets out of hand, but are weakened by animosity between the nations (see [[Politics of Coalition c. 078AF - 092AF]] for a written account). 

date: 089AF
title: The [[Invasion of Orcus]]
content:

[[The Grey Ordeal]] fight for months alongside the nations of the world against the influence of Orcus. After a long battle, Orcus was returned to wherever he once came. This battle culminated in the [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples|southeast]], specifically the region of [[Hyjeovo]].

date: 092AF
title: The Great Retirement
content:

[[The Grey Ordeal]] disbands, focusing on their domestic work in [[The Guilds]] or their other affairs. Under their watch, a great prosperity engulfs the lands, and this age ends. [[Tetrimoc]] no longer is a visible leader of his flock (as such his journal is widely distributed by scribes), and the [[Golden Claws]] become the driving political power of [[The Lands of Tetrimoc]].
```

## The Second Age / The Age of Wonder
