## The Known World
The world is young, or at the least, the history of it is.
Recorded history began only 148 years ago with the decent of the golden dragon Tetrimoc. His journals are a holy text for his followers and a great treasure to historians of the world. 
Soon after his fall, settlements sprouted. 
Around the golden dragon and the deserts he inhabits, a society was cultivated under his protection.
A force of flame quickly burnt the thick forests to the north-west, and the peoples reveled in it. The [[The Holy'lnds|lands of the Great White Flame]] is ruled by a fire-based theocracy.
The great King Arthur united the north-east under his banner only 40 years ago, driving out the small but powerful (and generally exploititive) powers that were. The Kingdom of Prosper is so; a now peaceful and prosperous land.
The south-eastern peoples are untied by thier differences, and their differences in governance to the groups around them. Groups of tribes, families, and companies "united under" (perhaps better described as "agreed to larger representation by") the Democratic Combine of Peoples.
In the center of the range of mountains that seperates that west and east stands a monument of the unity of the people; Coalition City. Run by the Guilds, Coalition City acts as the defacto capital of the Known World.

### On the Unknown World
But, perhaps you ask, what of the unknown lands? Surely the wilds have resources and peoples of thier own? Perhaps they do. It is unknown to the people of the Known Lands, but not to me or you. Those who have journied too far across the borders of thier lands have yet to return. The Guild of Rangers hold back the wilds. The further one travels, the further out of the prime-material plane one travels. One would first explore what they would consider simply more of the material plane, although they could notice some differences. This is known to the *very* few (perhaps a ranger with great studiousness or a wizard from ages long past) who know it to be the Border Lands. Others call it by many names, such as "The [[Wildlands]]", "The Impassable", or simply "Beyond". These areas act as bridge to the Etherial Plane, a ghostly visage of the Material Plane. This is where many of the threats that incroach on the Border Lands and the Material Planes lay. As it continues, it extends into the Astral Sea, and beyond it, the Elemental and Inner Planes. Traversing this system of planes on foot is possible, although *extremely* dangerous for many reasons (such as yknow dragons and shit).

### On the Weave
The Weave is the fabric of our reality. Some manipulate it through means of physicality (like fighters and rangers) and others through means of "magic", although those who study it can manipulate it much as one who studies physicality can manipulate (such as wizards and sorcerers). The physciality of our world is our observation of the Weave. The ones persons call gods are as much a manifestation of the Weave as any persons are, although they seem more a part of it than any others. 

Magic is generally crafted using the latent "Weave Potentia" that radiates throughout the lands.
