# Dragonic Lore

## Language

As Dragons have no lips, p, b, m, and such sounds are to be excluded as proper names for dragons and words in ancient draconic.

## General Notes

### Boons

A dragon who wishes to deal without wealth does so in Boons. Historically, a dragon's boon is simply an exchange of favors, but in dealings with ancient dragons and the like, one such favor could be nearly as powerful as a wish.

### On Good Dragons
Good dragons respect honor, even those chaotic bunch. Something to do with their Natural Weave? Good Dragons consider many things to be a dishonor, and will not willingly commit them to the best of thier ability.

>Such dishonors include, but are not limited to:
>Raising other Dragons from the Dead,

### On Evil Dragons
Evil dragons fight good ones at every opportunity, and vice versa.
