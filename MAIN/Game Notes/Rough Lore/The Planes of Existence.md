# The Material Plane
## Prime
The Prime Material Plane expands with the ebb and flow of life. It grows and shrinks as it needs to. This is a process that takes many years, and begins with sentient creatures exploring and quickens with mapping of the "film layer" in between [[#Prime]] and other planes. This is known as the [[#In Between]] to scholars studying the subject.

As an effect of this mechanic, a commoner can walk into [[#The Wildlands]] end up in their desired plane of existence, and never be seen again.

## Mirror Planes
So called "Mirror" planes of our [[#Prime]] plane exist. Some such include...

### The Feywild
A plane of growth, change, and powerful trickery. Inhabited by Eladrin, Gnomes, Satyr, Goblinkin, Fey, Giants, Sprites, Hag, and the [[Emotive Creatures]].

The Feywild is a shifting plane, where no path is permanent. The four seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall) are represented in force here; large growth is the enjoyment of the land in spring, a great slumber afflicts the plane in winter, and so on. Many of the Fey swear allegiance to [[The Feywild#The Monarchs|a Monarch]] and wage their seasonal war. No one Monarch has gained power over others in the known history of this plane structure, but one could imagine the devastation the [[#Prime]] would experience if this balance shifted in favor of one group or another. 


### The Underdark


# The [[Wildlands]]
## General
The [[Wildlands]] is the name that the people of [[#Prime]] give to the areas beyond their ability to return from. The [[#The Elemental Planes]], [[#The Energy Planes]], and even the [[#Mirror Planes]] and [[#The Outer Planes]] are considered [[Wildlands]].

## In Between...
The Ethereal is the beach of the Astral Sea. One walks into the [[#The Wildlands]], and things become strange, long and stretched, real but dreamlike. This is the Ethereal. 

As one continues through this Plane, they may end up walking many places; any of [[#The Elemental Planes]], [[#Mirror Planes]] or [[#The Astral Sea]]. Many threats to all of these such planes permeate the Ethereal and end up at another plane. In the case of the [[#Prime]] plane, this causes quite the disturbance, as most of the threats from these other planes are relatively quite powerful here, especially under organized assault (see [[Prime Timeline]] for examples).

If one were to attempt to escape the Ethereal simply by turning around and heading back home, they would find such a journey impossible. The only path through the Ethereal Plane is the path in front of you. Wherever does it lead?

## The Astral Sea
The Astral Sea is a great pink soup of mass and energy. It is visually similar to the concept of "floating islands", but the physical space of this plane is malleable via thought alone. This plane bends to its inhabitant's will.

If one has no destination in mind or loses that destination while traveling the Ethereal, one would end up in the Astral Sea. 

Many chose or are born into living their lives in this great Sea; some become thought pirates, others great information gatherers, others still attempt to live a simple peaceful life. 

## Planeswalking
Walking the planes and ending up where you want to be is possible, but very difficult. One must maintain concentration on the destination during the entire trip, including during rest. After a combat, the players must make a Constitution check, the DC of which is based on how 

## The Elemental Planes
### The Plane of Earth
### The Plane of Fire
### The Plane of Water
#### Great Glacier
Currently ruled by [[Jarl Grungar]]. A great glacier where the plane of Water and Air meet; the Plane of Ice.

### The Plane of Air


## The Outer Planes
The so called "afterlife". Alignment Extremists end up in one of four places. Non-extremists go to one of any number of other places, such as the many warrior spirits of Valhalla, or the lost souls of Limbo.

#### Mechanis, the Land of Law

#### The Abyss, the Land of Chaos

#### Elysium, the Land of Good

#### Nine Hells, the Land of Evil
