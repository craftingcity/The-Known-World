# Prenotes for Dec 11th
So far, [[The Whitimores]] have played only a background role in the story. I want them on the main stage alongside the Fire Giants of [[King Snure]].

If the party waits for over a few days, the [[The Whitimore]] may execute [[Jarl Grungar]] for failing to maintain the plan. The loyal Frost Giants are spared, and align themselves with [[King Snure]] for the "grand invasion". This event will happen a week after the Jarl's Execution.

***DOMINATE PERSON ADVANTAGE ON FIGHTING MONSTER (OK TO CHEESE!!!)***

[[Kakurak]] requests of the adventures that they walk [[The Planes of Existence]] without a return ticket, under the assumption that the fire giants would have some way of transporting themselves here. [[Kakurak]] admits to the adventurers that this is an extremely dangerous request, and he would not hold it against them should they refuse.

In either case, [[The Whitimores]] have plans for these meddling adventurers; a strike team has caught wind of their plans to stop the giants and will follow the adventurers for over a day before attacking at the most opportune time. Given victory, [[The Whitimores]] hold and interrogate these adventurers.
