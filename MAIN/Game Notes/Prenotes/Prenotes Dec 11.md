# Prenotes for Dec 11th
So far, [[The Whitimores]] have played only a background role in the story. I want them on the main stage alongside the Fire Giants of [[King Snure]].

If the party waits for over a few days, the [[The Whitimore]] may execute [[Jarl Grungar]] for failing to maintain the plan. The loyal Frost Giants are spared, and align themselves with [[King Snure]] for the "grand invasion". This event will happen a week after the Jarl's Execution.

***DOMINATE PERSON ADVANTAGE ON FIGHTING MONSTER (OK TO CHEESE!!!)***

[[Kakurak]] requests of the adventures that they walk [[The Planes of Existence]] without a return ticket, under the assumption that the fire giants would have some way of transporting themselves here. [[Kakurak]] admits to the adventurers that this is an extremely dangerous request, and he would not hold it against them should they refuse.

In either case, [[The Whitimores]] have plans for these meddling adventurers; a strike team has caught wind of their plans to stop the giants and will follow the adventurers for over a day before attacking at the most opportune time. Given victory, [[The Whitimores]] hold and interrogate these adventurers.

# Postnotes
This one was mostly improv. Kakurak played no role; Marcus verbally led the party to the town of [[Baskin]], who was the most recent raided city from [[The Assault of the Giant Decenters]]. Their church was covered in ice from the attack and harbored a Remorhaz mating pair.

[[The Whitimore]] were watching the party, and they saw their opportunity to strike. Bardaux was last to leave the city's church and was shot by a poisoned arrow from a [[The Varis Hit|Whitimore Assassin]], and quickly captured by the extraction team.

"You have something we want Bardaux... Varis has a greater role to play. I'm sure we'll speak again..." - An Unnamed Drow

I think that Varis' role is to be a Vessel for [Vhaeraun](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vhaeraun), whom the Whitimore are attempting to bring into the world so that the house Whitimore can "win" the underdark (y'know bc they have a god on their side).

I used the names [[Enoch Ben]] for the wood elf captain of the guard in [[Baskin]], Valerio Avishalom for the green dragonborn Grand Tendered of [[Baskin]], and [[Emuna Yanuv]] as an unraced tavernkeep who opened her doors to the public
