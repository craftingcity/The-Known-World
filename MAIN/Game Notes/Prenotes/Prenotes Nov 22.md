# PreNotes for 11/21/21

The party just fought a bunch of bugbear and the two hill giants from the torture chamber. They attempted to rest and were quickly interrupted by a group of orcs. The party recognized them as the rebellious slaves the bugbear were talking about and were asked to come to their lair; meet their leader, rest, and help them escape. 

Read boxtext on yellow paper for "begining of session"

Quickly after talking with the orcs they faintly hear a large bassy horn being blown long followed by two shorter blasts. This is a sign for the remaining forces to retreat to the upper keep (the "uprising" code). A roamer found the massacre of the bugbear lair and called for the retreat. 

As such, the following occurs:
- The Keeper (area 2) and his two **apes** retreat and join the upper front
- A total of 6 remaining bugbear from various area retreat and join the upper front
- The two **fire giants** and their dwarven slaves retreat. The one of the giants joins the fight and the other retreats to the fire keep with an ogre from the chief to alert the frost hold and then the fire keep. The dwarves are 
- The two **stone giants** in area 28 follow orders to retreat, and join their sister in the upper front.

In any case, the giants above have used the logs in storage to blockade the 10-10A secret door and prepare an assault on the lower works. It will take them 4 hours to contain their slaves, prepare the 10A defense, gear up and plan for the assault, etc.

The 19 **ogre** stay behind to watch the many slaves. The many young hill giants (of **orc** stats) are hunkered in the great hall, awaiting the all clear. The three **stone giant** siblings will not fight, but are not yet ready to leave. They brought their pay up with them, and if things look bad for the giants, they will simply leave.

For the fight, the Cheif Nostra (splint armor AC 17, *+1 warhammer*) uses the **frost giant** statistic, and the one **fire giant** joins the fight.
For the fight, the Keeper (chainmail AC 16, *+1 battleaxe*) and the Subcheif Regguq use the **stone giant** statistics and their special abilities. 
For the fight, 14 nameless hill giants and the cheif's wife Grutha (chainmail, AC 16) use the **hill giant** statistics. 
For the fight, the 20 hill giant ordaned servents are **ogre** in stats and the **bugbear** join the fight.
For the fight, the animals are two **apes**, two cave bears (with **polar bear** stats). 

The warband will enter the Lower Works through the pantry. They move throughout the level and set up servents at critical points while the rest of the giants roam and place. They begin by securing the Cheif's Vault, where Grutha will stay and make sure nothing is missing. Locking the secret doors behind them, they will continue south, in an attempt to secure the slaves and cells before expanding to the workrooms and eventually north to the barracks and storage. Finally, they will destroy the barracade and clear the natural caves.



If the party wishes to return to [Kakurak's Lair](simplenote://note/87e4a184-fc79-4123-bcd4-9dafe521e174), they may spend four days travelling on foot to the cave by the Firelight Sea. When they do, he will ask them to return the chain to him for study and to rest in his lair until further instructed. Given the night to examine the chain, he will return to the party and explain its construction and usage. He is concerned that the Hill Giant Keep is not the only incursion and would ask them to continue thier assualt.
