# Pre-Session notes for October 10th, Keep on the Hill Giant
[[Varis]] and [[Amashod]] are raised by Kakurak, whose brother has since died. As a bound sorcerer, [[Varis]] will comply with the request of Kakurak to infiltrate and assault the Keep of The Hill Giants. The rest of the party is offered a boon of friendship, but not binding. This is a oneshot, they will comply.

The Party Coalesces, and is introduced to a blind druid, [[Marco]] (level 6 druid, prefers bugs), to guide them. They have a prepared map (which we will print and hand to the players), and are ready and willing to be a guide to the structure. [[Marco]] has found the few secret doors of the Upper Works.

# Post-Live Notes
We did a lil intro with [[Varis]]' death/revival, character creation took so long and I had to leave so early that we only got to fight the dogs, which the party dispatched with little trouble. They alerted a giant, however, who raised an intruder call. Under the effect of a dominate person spell from [[Varis]], then called a false alarm. The party summilarily executed him quickly after (the "handsome hill giant" from area 19). His suitors are left waiting, and may possibly investigate.
