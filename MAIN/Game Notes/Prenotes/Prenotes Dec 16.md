# Prenotes for Dec 16th
It looks to me like the players are headed into the underdark to rescue their friend! This means a few things; they have to get into the underdark, brave its threats, find information on where [[Bardaux]] is being held, and break (or bargain) him out alive.

Cool! This seems like a lot of stuff I don't have to figure out right now and or already have the big picture for. [[Bardaux]] is being held somewhere secret, a [[The Whitimore Files|Whitimore]] compound somewhere hidden in the Deep. Only some higher ranking members of the House would know where this place is, let alone that it (specifically) exists. They wont be directly interacting with this on their next session, and if they do, your word is law, but do not let that prevent you from speaking.

Which means we have to prep more for the first two; Getting to the underdark, and braving its threats on the hunt for information. see [[Underdark]] for a rundown of the general stuffs about the underdark.

I imagine that [[Varis]] and [[Amashod]] would suggest heading to the place that they exited the Underdark from, and I think that it would make sense for the portal to still be there, but the cave it was in has refilled its inhabitance and the tunnels from the surface into the deep have changed.

- [ x ] Build/Find a dungeon crawl for the "portal to the underdark" to be in

After they're in the Shallows, they need to get to the Deep before they can get any real information on specifics of Drow goings on. An ally made in the Shallows can guide them, or simply point the way. Maybe they also have a reason to traverse the Deep.

# During Notes
[[Kursk]]'s introduction has gone well. The classic "walks over to the table and introduces self to party".
Fought bear and Ahnkeg
