### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had finally made progress. Upon a small island surrounded by dark rivers, the party traversed a tower occupied by a living human man, though he has surely now lost some portion of his mind. 

We return to them now, moments after they have restrained this ancient man by their chains. The air in the tower stands stagnant - the hunt for a *safe* way home is still ongoing.
