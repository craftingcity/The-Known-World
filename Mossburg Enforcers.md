# Mossburg Enforcers
## History
The Mossburg Enforcers originated in [[Mossburg]], but have since expanded to manage all of [[Baron Vannis]]' holdings - though they've kept the name and symbology as an ode to their history.
## Governance
The Mossburg Enforcers follow a militiristic rank system, ending in the City Captain. The City Captains answer to [[Baron Vannis]] directly, and coordinate with the local "power-players" to manage their assignments.
