### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were delving into the depths of a once active temple to the extraplanar being known as Orcus. Through much grueling exploration, the party gathered descriptions of much of the artwork and environment in the upper floor of the temple, and a vision of what may have been happening here some dozen years ago was cast. 

Though this exploration, the party encountered a group of animated skeletons as they arose from pools of dark murky waters. These aberrations were unsuccessful in their attempts to take your life. With this first floor effectively cleared and explored, two sets of staircases lead deeper into the temple.

### What does the World Know?

Much of the description of the Noble Theives in this place are in the [[Prenotes May 07 23]] notes.

We're gonna push everyone down to the second floor, where we will be encountering the first of the living fanatics, more undeadzies, and the gang of Noble Thieves.
