### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were delving into the depths of a once active temple to the extraplanar being known as Orcus. Through much grueling exploration, the party gathered descriptions of much of the artwork and environment in the upper floor of the temple, and a vision of what may have been happening here some dozen years ago was cast. 

Though this exploration, the party encountered a group of animated skeletons as they arose from pools of dark murky waters. These aberrations were unsuccessful in their attempts to take your life. With this first floor effectively cleared and explored, two sets of staircases lead deeper into the temple.

### What does the World Know?

Much of the description of the Noble Thieves in this place are in the [[Prenotes May 07 23]] notes.

We're gonna push everyone down to the second floor, where we will be encountering the first of the living fanatics, more undeadzies, and the gang of Noble Thieves.

> First, the 6 noble thieves. 4 from Cobalt's group (Batii the Calm, Heaver the Dreader, Mol the Restless, Vander the Strong) and 2 from Agrandica's (Gyan the Wracked and Vlal the Honorable) - they are working together for the time being in search of any signs of [[Ranger's Guild]] patrols in the area at the behest of the Guilds and their immediate superiors. They are currently keeping quiet in the bottom of the crypts room, and all of them have some manner of exhaustions. If necessary, they will fight or work with the party, whatever will get everyone out as alive as possible (everyone on my team at least).

The party is likely to loot the crypt to the best of their ability which may be better than the Thieves; There is 8400 cp, 2500 sp, 70 gp, black onyx (150 gp), 3 x diamond (100 gp), amber (100 gp), amethyst (100 gp), garnet (100 gp), tourmaline (100 gp), Potion of Resistance (thunder) (uncommon, dmg 188), Driftglobe (uncommon, dmg 166), Potion of Hill Giant Strength (uncommon, dmg 187), Wand of Magic Detection (uncommon, dmg 211), twenty vials of perfume in a pouch (100 gp, 2 lb), a barrel of perry (12 gp, 320 lb)
