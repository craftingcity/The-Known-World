### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had gathered supplies and information in and around Coalition City. With questions remaining - such as, what is Web Spun Solutions, why has Mountain Hall gone quarantine, and who the hell tried to kill us in the Mining Colony - the party seeks answers in their immediate goal to fulfill or at least investigate the requests of a Prosperian Noble by the name of Duche Hedwig a'Alden, who wishes for Eve to prepare a report regarding those responsible for the burning of crop fields in the city of [[Bandeer]]. 

We return to the party after their travel through the Iron Ward and the Adventure's Road, as the sunlight bears down high in the sky and the party views the city of [[Bandeer]] for the first time together.

	- the farmstead is owned by the Hardwick family, father Algor, mother Britanna, and sons Yohan and Jonas. the Hardwicks have a muddy reputation, as Algor has a lifelong history of minor crimes or lies.
	- Yohan is a spike-recruit for the Mountain Trooper Corps, and burnt down the farm as both a taxing evasion scheme and a job from the MTC. He will attempt to make his way to mountain hall after not hearing from the MTC for a few weeks.
	- red herrings include; a local gang of dwarven ruffians - though they agree that the Prosperian state is better, they are aligned towards their own power, a number of locals with grudges against the Hardwicks, and a powerful farmer who has attempted to buy out the Hardwick farm.
