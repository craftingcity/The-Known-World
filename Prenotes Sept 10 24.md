### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had gathered supplies and information in and around Coalition City. With questions remaining - such as, what is Web Spun Solutions, why have portions Mountain Hall gone quarantine, and who the hell tried to kill us in the Mining Colony - the party seeks answers in their immediate goal to fulfill or at least investigate the requests of a Prosperian Noble by the name of Duche Hedwig a'Alden, who wishes for Eve to prepare a report regarding those responsible for the burning of crop fields in the city of [[Bandeer]]. 

We return to the party after their travel through the Iron Ward and the Adventure's Road, as the sunlight bears down high in the sky and the party views the city of [[Bandeer]] for the first time together.

### What does the World Know?

They don't need to travel much further before they will arrive in [[Bandeer]]. [[Hedwig a'Alden]] would greet them if they were to come to the townhall, and he would explain the situation;

	- on the 15th of Replowing in the 106th year (the date of the Summer Communicae), a large field of Rye in Bandeer was torched.
	- the farmstead is owned by the Hardwick family, father Algor, mother Britanna, and sons Yohan and Jonas. the Hardwicks have a muddy reputation, as Algor has a lifelong history of minor crimes or lies.
	- Yohan is a false-recruit for the Northern Loyalists, and burnt down the farm as both a taxing evasion scheme and a job from the NLs. He will attempt to make his way to mountain hall after not hearing from the NLs for a few weeks.
	- red herrings include; a local gang of dwarven ruffians - though they agree that the Prosperian state is better, they are aligned towards their own power, a number of locals with grudges against the Hardwicks, and a powerful farmer who has attempted to buy out the Hardwick farm.

#### Hardwicks
*Algor Hardwick* - Father of two, Hardworking, previous ties with the Black Swans before meeting Britanna. 
*Britannya Hardwick* - Mother of two, Clever, near recent immigrant from Eastern Mosslick.
*Jonas Hardwick* - Older brother, Wierd - meaning lacking in empathy, spends majority of time alone.
*Yohan Hardwick* - Younger brother - child; too young to understand.
#### Black Swans
Ubrik Banks
Gren Judge
Lodeav Riven
#### Bandeer Farmhand Union
Forage Estatses - primarily an orchard, but has significant stake in local cannabis
Banks Farm - primarily a rye/wheat farm
Whyre Blackacid - a huge rye/wheat farm that also has a significant stake in local cannabis
