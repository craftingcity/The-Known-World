### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were travelling along the [[Alvalini River]] by way of Captain [[Revari Madrid]]'s ship - 'The Embargo' - but have decided that it would be best to continue into the city of [[Boneborn]] by way of land, and have exchanged wishes of good travels as you parted ways.

You are still in [[Zalfari]], and Captain Madrid would be in town for today and tomorrow if you wish to reconsider your decision to travel on land, and you know that you will be heading east towards your quarry for many miles.

With this journey ahead of you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

[[Boneborn]] is a massive-walled city, but it's gates are open to all.

The [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] is of great interest, and for the most part, is a haystack when they are looking for a set of needles. The needles in question are a series of independent merchants under contract with [[Baron Xuiop]] for the Bash - though their assistant [[Pearce Thomas]] was the person who drew up the list for approval, with this intention. 

These merchants are selling off materials and goods scavenged and stolen by the membership of the Cults Infernal and cooking books with the actual money they've taken as well.

In Zalfari, they checked for cultist knives via Locate Object and found that someone staying in the bar across the street from them does in fact have a knife, one of the Merchants headed to the Bash.

After travelling for a few days, they arrive in [[Boneborn]] on the 13th of Resowing and are resting in the Silver Unicorn tonight. They will look to an alchemist or apothecary to find creatures to hunt or areas to gather materials in, and or perhaps visiting Nala's home village.
