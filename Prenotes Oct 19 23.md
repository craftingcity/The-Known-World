### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were travelling along the [[Alvalini River]] by way of Captain [[Revari Madrid]]'s ship - 'The Embargo' - but have decided that it would be best to continue into the city of [[Boneborn]] by way of land, and have exchanged wishes of good travels as you parted ways.

You are still in [[Zalfari]], and Captain Madrid would be in town for today and tomorrow if you wish to reconsider your decision to travel on land, and you know that you will be heading south-east towards your quarry.
