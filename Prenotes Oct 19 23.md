### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were travelling along the [[Alvalini River]] by way of Captain [[Revari Madrid]]'s ship - 'The Embargo' - but have decided that it would be best to continue into the city of [[Boneborn]] by way of land, and have exchanged wishes of good travels as you parted ways.

You are still in [[Zalfari]], and Captain Madrid would be in town for today and tomorrow if you wish to reconsider your decision to travel on land, and you know that you will be heading east towards your quarry for many miles.

With this journey ahead of you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

[[Boneborn]] is a massive-walled city, but it's gates are open to all.

The [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] is of great interest, and for the most part, is a haystack when they are looking for a set of needles. The needles in question are a series of independent merchants under contract with [[Baron Xuiop]] for the Bash - though their assis. 

These merchants are selling off materials and goods scavenged and stolen by the membership of the Cults Infernal and cooking books with the actual money they've taken as well.
