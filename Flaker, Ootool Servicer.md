# Name of Char

> Imagine if you would, a human man in his 40s. He has lived underground his whole life, his skin is nearly transparent and colorless. His features are weak, you imagine that he is eating just enough to survive eat day.

Flaker is an Ootool Servicer - part of a group of humanoids that follow the will of Ootool and reap its benefits - and has been with the colony for as long as he can remember at this point.

Flaker is Ootool's mouth piece when people come to town. When he's not working with newcomers, he tends to his garden and performs duty the Consciousness would ask of him, which generally is working with other Servicers when they have issues of any kind and working with the non-servicecer population to facilitate anything they need.

## History
Flaker was born and raised in the Underdark, and has had a good life following Ootool. For some time, he was a generalist, but Ootool has given him a noble purpose, to be a coordinator and greeter.
