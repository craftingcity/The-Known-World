# Paths through Power
As characters reach 20th level they become extremely powerful forces of change in any setting. On Alaturmen, beings of "level" higher than this become like gods. There are certain "paths" that these higher level characters follow.

## Divine
Those beings that gain power through Faith eventually become reliant on it to power their existence and become the heads of cults or churches or their deity.

### Necrotic
By following the path of the Necromancer, one attempts to brute-force the Weave to give the practitioner power over life and death. 

Generally, this power is too much for any mortal to safely handle, leveled beyond 20 or not; absolute power corrupts absolutely.

## Draconic


### Sorceric


## Fae


### Wild


## Elemental
By harnessing the base elements of physicality, one follows a path to ancient power.

### Weave Arcane
When a mage crafts their own magics through the formulas of Weave Arcane, they produce an affect that can emulate almost any other path of power, but without the proper guidance, one would drown in the possibilities along this path before reaching its truest conclusion; dunamancy.
