Nearly two weeks to the day of the publishing article, our Coalition was rocked by a force of Arcani that has become known as the Hum. Many of you witnessed this event, and in an attempt to quell fear in those of you who did not, we took deliberate time in forming our response - for our lack of haste, we are sorry.

The force in question first came to us even before these two weeks ago. Our Wizards tell me that in fact this force has been seen before, in a terrifyingly similar capacity, twenty-six years ago. 

Those of us who know the tales of [[The Grey Ordeal]] can speak upon the distraught of the 89th year; though many of us may know them know as friends and family, the Gnoll first came to Alaturmen then, with their hunger burning in their pit, as warbands fighting side-by-side with horrors unseen. Their arrival was known throughout our Coalition by the alert of our Bards - and more relevantly the Hum Arcani they heard.

Rangers were able to save many settlements, but many of your homes did fall - to warbands or insurrectionists alike. Our Wizards and our Adventurers, most notably and namely [[The Grey Ordeal]], were able to quell the most major threat, but not without loss. Again, those who know the story can corroborate that [[Eladrithal Greystone]] and [[Waywalket Turring]] would go on to become major icons in our Guilds and honor their fallen comrade in doing so.

My use of quell is specific and intentional. This major threat is not gone, and in fact stands at the door to our home once again. The Guilds need you. I spoke with the Yellow Mage, [[Nicolas Talaveem]], and I asked what he would say to the common citizen. He said the following; 

"I would request that we do not falter. That we stay strong, that our Coalition stays strong. Know that the Council of Mages is working diligently with the Guild of Adventurers to maneuver our defenses towards our great enemy. You may see more Rangers or Adventurers passing through or seeking refuge within your holdings. Know that these actors are here for your safety, and please, perform any task they ask of you within the best of your abilities. We have been silent in our contemplation, but we now must act - as one. We do not name our enemy for its utterance is an invitation into its grasp. To those among you who can perform crafts of Weave Arcane - I urge you to take great care in your continued exploration. "
