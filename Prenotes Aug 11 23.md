### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were on guard with a [[Ammarin Transportation]] Caravan, and were halted by a suspicious growth on the roads. As soon as the group investigated, they were attacked by a group of bandits wielding slings and swords. 

During the battle, the party suffered minor damage, but after a short burst of combat, they emerged victorious.
