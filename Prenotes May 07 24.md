### Intro
When we first meet our heroes, they do not yet know that they are our heroes. They do not know the role they are to play in the events to come. These five people will be the final arbitrators of what is to come upon the face of Alaturmen, but we watch as they begin more simply. A job.

War has come to the North and the merchants in the hills of the [[Deakred Range]] are making a killing. Profits are up, and contractors are in vouge. You five have all - for your own separate reasons - signed up for minor work for some time, and in doing so, you have all somehow come to be in the grand city of [[Mountain Hall]], the capital city of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Suremantle]]. 

As the fates align, you each have found work with a small up-and-coming independent mining company known as [[Web Spun Solutions]], where you have been contracted to escort a caravan for just over thirteen weeks as it travels back and forth between its depot in Mountain Hall and a newly purchased plot in "Mining Colony 15". With the promise of continued work upon their satisfaction, and an address for complementary room and board, you all have gathered yourselves and your equipment, shaken the sleep from your eyes, and made your way to the depot for your first day on this contract.

With your pleasantries presented, and your roles assigned, you have set off with your driver - Edgars - to the 35th plot in the 15th Mining Colony, 10 miles west-north-west of the city limits of [[Mountain Hall]]. 

We look onto the party. A clear blue sky welcomes you as you travel through the mountains on this cool morning, the 1st of Plowing in the 106th year. You can hear the wind slowly crawling its way through the massive rocks, the birds chirping and singing in the branches of the slightly swaying trees.

### What does the World Know?
"Mining Colony 15" is 11 miles west-north-west of [[Mountain Hall]].
The caravan will be halted and accosted by the [[Northern Liberationists]] for the purposes of disrupting the [[Web Spun Solutions]] company's ability to supply the [[Northern Conflicts of 105AF]].

They will first try to reason with the driver, and will inevitably fail, leading them to move in and forcibly halt and redirect the caravan.

### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
