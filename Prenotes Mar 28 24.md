### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had returned to the forward-operating post of the resistance effort against the fiendish forces in the Combine. You gathered yourselves and have continued pushing alongside your friendly forces towards [[Black Egal]], once the home of some fifteen-hundred people, it now is host to a force of fiends awaiting destruction by your hands.

You four and your patron wizard are camping a dozen hundred feet outside the city limits as you finish your meals and begin to separate watches. 

### What does the World Know?

Nala and Shep have first watch.
Jerran has second watch, and will be alone.
Alergra has third watch, and will be alone.

There is a standing force of 6 squads of 20, 2 of Cousins, 1 of Apes, 1 of Spines, and 2 of Hounds stationed in [[Black Egal]].
