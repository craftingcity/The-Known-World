### Intro

When last we left our heroes, a deal was struck. A modest sum to the five most powerful mages in the world, but a grand prize to our heroes - a total of one million silver. In addition to your newfound wealth and reputation, you have managed to auction your captive for enchantments, to which [[Qiell Tilemundon]], the Black Mage on the Council happily took you up on.

We return to our heroes nearly as soon as we left them. Qiell has discussed with you the items you wished to have enchanted or crafted whole-cloth and guarantees that he will be able to provide them to you in two days time. Upon the high-noon of the Fourth of Weeding, your items will be sent to you by pinpoint teleportation in a sealed crate. 

Of note, Ren has expressed a desire to retire. Taking her cut of the coin and her receipt for her new gardening equipment, she has left for the hell of paperwork that is officially becoming a mutually-voluntary-retiree-adventurer. After this, she will head north-east to her homeland, and return to her family.

For the rest of you, I must put the question to you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?
