# Introduction

# Part 1 - General Information
## The World is Young
The goblinoids lived without time; hunting, gathering, and supposedly swimming in primordial soup. Then, "the Immortal Yellow Dragon, the Great Tetrimoc" fell from the sky, cut himself on a [[Kailkeep|rock]], and hid in a hid in a hole. Finally; everyone else came too. Elves born from Eladrin parents traveled here, carved the first dwarves from the stone, told the first legends of halfling, found the first humans lying naked in their fields. The elves claim to be first to find many of the other peoples too, but they always lay claim to too much. 

History began for these new people with the fall of [[Tetrimoc]]. The elves say that this place was made for him to fall to, this is the truth, so much as it was what they were told by their parents. 

[[Tetrimoc's Journal]] is a ancient document that records this time; it is like a word of god to some. For this reason, people record this era's years with the moniker AF, meaning after fall. Assuredly, some other grand event will cause their successors to change the convention.

In the first years, these two peoples were weary and cautious. They both had little information of each other and their intentions. This tension was broken by the young Arthur Simonson as he fought for justice against the tyrants of the human and goblin settlements in the Northeast. Largely due to this act, the humanoid people live in relative harmony with the goblinoid people, and for many, their societies have completely intertwined.

## Geography

At the edge of the land, the common folk will tell you to venture no further. They are right to warn you. Some magic breaths in this world. The Weave grows and shrinks the world to its whims. When people go too far, they do not come back. Unless you speak of [[Eledrathil Greystone]], but that is another tale. 

### Northeast
In the Northeast, as I have spoken of, are dense forests and open plains, rolling hills connecting the lot. The common folk of this world call this quarter of the world either simply "the Northeast" or "[[The Kingdom of Prosper]]". 

Most of the goblinoid inhabitants that do not actually live within the Kingdom of Prosper (and especially the ones that are in an open war against it) perfer "the Northeast". 

Most of the humanoids that live there would prefer the latter however, as most of them actually do live in Arthur's Kingdom.

### Northwest
In the northwest lie [[The Holy'lnds]]. In the first years of this world, a [[Its Greatness|great white flame]] burnt the whole of the northwestern fourth of the world. It stopped before the mountains of the desert and it burnt deep into the great northern forests. Few people or structures survived. Then, it stopped, pulled back, and the people flooded into its arms. They now worship this fire, for it allows itself to be contained in their braziers and hearths.

### Southwest
In the Southwest, a vast desert stretches from the mountains on its northern edge to the great [[Alavini River|Alavini]] river that flows along eastern. Most of this desert is known as [[The Outlands]], where bands of thieves and nomads are left to roam and steal. In the desert's heart [[The Golden City]] stands tall. Opulent and Imperial, this city is home to most of the business that goes on in the desert, even much of the thievery that occurs in the Outlands has a central line of communication to and from the city. 

### Southeast
In the southeast, a great amount of water lays upon the land, making much of the earth wet and swampy. This is very useful for growing food, which is much of what occurs in the [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], but the people of this land make war among themselves here too.

Unlike the other nations of this world, the Democratic Combine is less a united government and more a universal legal system. The many that use the Combine as their system make war against eachother over resource, but will fiercely and effectively defend each other from "outside" attacks. 

### Coalition City
Standing, carved into the center of the largest mountains at the eastern end of the [[Desert's Range]], a grand metropolis was born out of the need for communication and peace among the peoples of this world. The city is split into nine wards, each of which may as well be a city upon itself.
Each of the wards has a purpose that allows the greater city to prosper, and some even have purpose for the world at large.

[[The Guilds]] are a respected group of people who hold roles in the world at large. They are often respected and honored guests of the nations that host them, creating a connected network of Wizards, Merchants, Craftsfolk, and the like.
