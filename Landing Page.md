# Introduction

# Part 1 - General Information
## The World is Young
The goblinoids lived without time; hunting, gathering, and supposedly swimming in primordial soup. Then, "the Immortal Yellow Dragon, the Great Tetrimoc" fell from the sky, cut himself on a [[Kailkeep|rock]], and hid in a hid in a hole. Finally; everyone else came too. Elves born from Eladrin parents traveled here, carved the first dwarves from the stone, told the first legends of halfling, found the first humans lying naked in their fields. The elves claim to be first to find many of the other peoples too, but they always lay claim to too much. 

History began for these new people with the fall of [[Tetrimoc]]. The elves say that this place was made for him to fall to, this is the truth, so much as it was what they were told by their parents. 

[[Tetrimoc's Journal]] is a ancient document that records this time; it is like a word of god to some. For this reason, people record this era's years with the moniker AF, meaning after fall. Assuredly, some other grand event will cause their successors to change the convention.

In the first years, these two peoples were weary and cautious. They both had little information of each other and their intentions. This tension was broken by the young Arthur Simonson as he fought for justice against the tyrants of the human and goblin settlements in the Northeast. Largely due to this act, the humanoid people live in relative harmony with the goblinoid people, and for many, their societies have completely intertwined.

## Geography

At the edge of the land, the common folk will tell you to venture no further. They are right to warn you. Some magic breaths in this world. The Weave grows and shrinks the world to its whims. When people go too far, they do not come back. Unless you speak of [[Eledrathil Greystone]], but that is another tale. 

### Northeast
In the Northeast, as I have spoken of, are dense forests and open plains, rolling hills connecting the lot. The common folk of this world call this quarter of the world either simply "the Northeast" or "[[The Kingdom of Prosper]]". 

Most of the goblinoid inhabitants that do not actually live within the Kingdom of Prosper (and especially the ones that are in an open war against it) perfer "the Northeast". 

Most of the humanoids that live there would prefer the latter however, as most of them actually do live in Arthur's Kingdom.

### Northwest
In the northwest lie [[The Holy'lnds]]. In the first years of this world, a [[Its Greatness|great white flame]] burnt the whole of the northwestern fourth of the world. It stopped before the mountains of the desert and it burnt deep into the great northern forests. Few people or structures survived. Then, it stopped, pulled back, and the people flooded into its arms. They now worship this fire, for it allows itself to be contained in their braziers and hearths.

### Southwest
In the Southwest, a vast desert stretches from the mountains on its northern edge to the great [[Alavini River|Alavini]] river that flows along eastern. Most of this desert is known as [[The Outlands]], where bands of thieves and nomads are left to roam and steal. In the desert's heart [[The Golden City]] stands tall. Opulent and Imperial, this city is home to most of the business that goes on in the desert, even much of the thievery that occurs in the Outlands has a central line of communication to and from the city. 

### Southeast
In the southeast, a great amount of water lays upon the land, making much of the earth wet and swampy. This is very useful for growing food, which is much of what occurs in the [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], but the people of this land make war among themselves here too.

Unlike the other nations of this world, the Democratic Combine is less a united government and more a universal legal system. The many that use the Combine as their system make war against eachother over resource, but will fiercely and effectively defend each other from "outside" attacks. 

### Coalition City
Standing, carved into the center of the largest mountains at the eastern end of the [[Desert's Range]], a grand metropolis was born out of the need for communication and peace among the peoples of this world. The city is split into nine wards, each of which may as well be a city upon itself.
Each of the wards has a purpose that allows the greater city to prosper, and some even have purpose for the world at large.

[[The Guilds]] are a respected group of people who hold roles in the world at large. They are often respected and honored guests of the nations that host them, creating a connected network of Wizards, Merchants, Craftsfolk, and the like.

## Big Notes from the World
Coalition City is the biggest up-and-coming power in the world. The Kingdom and the Church have some contention, as they are both militarily strong, but neither could survive attacking the other at this time. The Kingdom and the Combine are in a similar holding pattern, but the military power of the Combine is much more guerrilla than outright warpower. Noone dares threaten the Lands of Tetrimoc, even with his recent disappearance.

The places to learn or study would be the Wizards of the world. They hold the knowledge that must be kept for our continuation.

Legend tells of many dangers in between the civilized lands. Beasts and Terrors hold just upon the edges of civilization, wearing away. 

Much of the treasure of the world is held in horde, still yet to be plundered, but a handsome price some may pay for a job done well.

Most people use barter to trade for resources, as most people do not carry minted coin, but coin and merchant bar is acceptable currency nearly anywhere. The Kingdom of Prosper has a large treasury, and has spread coin around the world, making it the dominant currency, but each of the "nations" of the world mint their own coin.

The people of the world have [[The Worldwide Calander Systems|different names]] for the days of the week and months of the year, but they all use a 7 day week and a 52 week year.

Travel from one side of the world to the other takes a month. Crossing a nation takes roughly a week. Travel is easy, but unrefined.

The most common languages spoken are Desertspeech, High Common, King's Common, and Swampish. They are all born of the languages of the humans and elves, often with historical language of the goblins, dragons, eladrin, and triton.

# Questions Unanswered
## Power and Punishment
There are four "national" level powers, the church, the kingdom, the immortal dragon (but mostly [[Golden Claws]]), and the united forces of [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]]. There are gr

Who is in charge and what are they in charge of? Are there any powerful nations, dynasties, corporations, or organizations that the players should be aware of? What is the source of their power? What is illegal? Who enforces the law? What are typical punishments for crimes?

Power and punishment  
## Daily life 
What is the role of magic or technology in the life of most people? Are there any common professions? Are the majority of folk cosmopolitan or parochial? What do commoners fear or want? NPCs List and describe some important non-player characters or entities in your world. These could be rulers, powerful spellcasters, or mentors. Don’t limit yourself here to just individuals. Describe any important factions, organizations, armies, or corporations. Consider describing “monsters” here too. Players should know about the greedy lich who sends zombies to attack the city every three years and the tribe of ogres who control the old forest. 

## Magic, gods, and the planes 
What is the role of magic in your world? Is it respected or feared (or some combination of the two). How can one acquire magical powers? Who are the gods or main faiths of your world? What are their attitude towards mortals? What other planes or dimensions influence our world? Can someone or something travel between our world and another plane?

# Part 2 - Player Information 
The second half of your campaign bible should focus exclusively on helping players make characters and start the game. Information to write in this part should include basics on each of the species/races and classes so that players can make informed decisions when creating their characters. Make sure the starting location or event of the campaign is described so your players can create characters that are ready to begin adventuring when you actually start playing! Species in your world This should be a few short sentences describing the status, demographics, and role of each of the major species in your game. Players should know, for example, if halflings are the majority, are common, or are rarely seen in a given place. Rough percentages can help here. You may also want to add a sentence or two explaining why a member of a particular species might be an adventurer or be part of your campaign. Include a list common names for members of each species or culture. You can write these yourself or point players in the direction of an appropriate list, for example the entry on Dwarves in the PHB or a list of Roman names. Classes in your world This should quickly describe the frequency and status of each class. Is this class respected? Loathed? Something in-between? You will also want to add why a member of this class would be involved in the start of your campaign. Consider including brief descriptions of class-specific organizations or factions. For example, a sentence describing a barbarian tribe, a thieves guild, or a wizard academy will help players make characters in those classes that fit in with your world. Starting location or event You should also include details about the starting location of your campaign. This could be a description of the town or neighborhood where the game begins or a description of an event (a ball, an invasion, a party) that starts the adventure. As you did in Part 1, write a few sentences describing important places, daily life, and interesting NPCs for your starting location. Character hooks Write several character hooks or traits explaining why an adventurer might be at the starting adventure or location for the first session. Think of these as ways to link your players into the campaign. For example, if your game begins with the coronation of a new king, then your campaign traits might be a list of reasons characters would attend this event. Some rules systems have mechanical options that may help you incorporate a character hook, for example, traits in Pathfinder or backgrounds in D&D 5e. New rules If you have any new rules, equipment, spells, backgrounds, feats, or other options for your players, it may be a good idea to include them in the campaign bible. New rules don’t have to be mechanical! You can, for example, ask your players to consider their social status (are the from common or noble blood?) and their experience or naivety with the wider world (are they from a newly-contacted backwater planet or the center of the galaxy?). A brand new class or species probably deserves its own independent document, but you should also include a brief description of this new option in your bible.
