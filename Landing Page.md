# Introduction

# Part 1 - General Information
## The World is Young
Those of you that were "born" here know this all too well. The goblinoids lived without time; hunting, gathering, and supposedly swimming in primordial soup. Then, "the Immortal Yellow Dragon, the Great, Tetrimoc" fell from the sky, cut himself on a rock, and hid in a hid in a hole. Finally; everyone else came too. Elves born from Eladrin parents traveled here, carved the first dwarves from the stone, told the first legends of halfling, found the first humans lying naked in their fields. The elves claim to be first to find many of the other peoples too, but they always lay claim to too much. 

History began for these new people with the fall of [[Tetrimoc]]. The elves say that this place was made for him to fall to, so they were told. 

[[Tetrimoc's Journal]] is a ancient document that records this time; it is like a word of god to some. For this reason, people record this era's years with the moniker AF, meaning after fall. Assuredly, some other grand event will cause their successors to change the convention.

The humanoid people live in some harmony now with the goblinoid people, and for many, their societies have intertwined.

In the year 013AF, the young heir of the Simonson Clan was born
