### Ecology

Besides its many predatory races and monsters, the Underdark is also home to a variety of natural animals that live out their lives normally below the ground. These animals include (but are not limited to) bats, crickets (and cricket droppings and eggs), eyeless cavefish and crayfish, springfish, salamanders, rats, flies and gnats, and spiders. Additionally, it is not unusual for creatures in the Upperdark to encounter the occasional raccoon, frog, stray dog, or even lost dwarf, elf, or other representative of a surface race who has accidentally fallen down a deep shaft or well.

#### Plants and Fungi

Plants of one kind or another are the beginning of any food chain. By organizing inorganic minerals and capturing the energy of sunlight, plants create food that animals of all kinds depend on. Since plants in the Underdark do not have access to sunlight, they must make food by other means. Thus, most take very different forms than the green plants of the surface world.

Most of the Underdark's plant life consists of a tremendous variety of fungi. Fungus normally requires some amount of detritus or decaying material to thrive. So where does the fungus find its food? The answer is simple: magic. The natural magical radiation of the Underdark and its various planar connections support many weird fungal growths, as well as lichens, mosses, and other simple plants, whose existence would otherwise be impossible. In effect, _faerzress_ is the sunlight of the Underdark, forming the basis of the subterranean food chain. Underdark regions particularly rich in _faerzress_ or planar energies have been known to support fantastic forests of pale, gnarled trees or crystalline plants. These growths are completely adapted to their lightless, hostile environment.

Surprisingly, however, green plants are not entirely absent from the Underdark. Some caverns illuminated by particularly bright radiant crystals can actually support green plants. Caves with this sort of dazzling illumination might be filled with grass; moss, ferns, creepers, or even small trees. Any such place is a treasure beyond price in the Underdark, and it is certain to be guarded by deadly spells, monstrous guardians, or both.

**Barrelstalk**: Stout as a hogshead of ale, the barrelstalk is a large, cask-shaped fungus that grows up to 8 feet in height and 5 feet in diameter. Its outer layers are tough and woody, but its inner flesh is edible, and its center is filled with a reservoir of water (usually from 20 to 50 gallons) that can be tapped and drained. The inner flesh turns black and poisonous when barrelstalk begins producing spores, which happens after ten years of growth.

**Bluecap**: The grain of the Underdark, bluecap fungus is inedible to humanoids, but its spores can be ground to make a nutritious, if bland, flour. Bread made from bluecap flour is usually known as sporebread. Bluecap seems to do well with or without _faerzress_, and most Underdark humanoids cultivate it.

**Cave Moss**: Found only in _faerzress_-rich regions, cave moss is inedible to humanoids, but it is a favorite grazing food of some giant vermin, as well as rothé.

**Fire Lichen**: Pale orange-white in color, fire lichen thrives on warmth, so it grows in regions of geothermal heat or near connections to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Fire lichen can be ground and fermented into a hot, spicy paste, which is often spread on sporebread to give it flavor. Duergar ferment fire lichen into a fiercely hot liquor.

**Luurden**: Luurden, or bloodfruit, is a rare tree that grows only in areas of strong _faerzress_. The barren branches of this pale, gnarled tree seem more dead than alive, but once every to 4 years, it produces a small amount of bitter red fruit that is used to make rare Underdark wines and elixirs.

**Ripplebark**: A shelflike fungus that resembles nothing so much as a mass of rotting flesh, ripplebark is surprisingly edible without any special preparation, although it tastes much better if cooked properly. Ripplebark grows naturally in living caves.

**Sussur**: Rare and magical, the so-called "deeproot" tree is found only in the largest of caverns. It can grow to a height of 60 feet, and its branches are long and gnarled, with banyanlike aerial roots. Few leaves grow on the sussur; it exists almost entirely on _faerzress_ and is often found in caverns where wizard fire is prevalent, a sussur tree can drink in magic from its environs, so most sussurs are surrounded by antimagic fields that extend for hundreds of feet.

**Waterorb**: This bulbous fungus is aquatic. It grows in boulder-like patches underwater wherever the water deposits detritus.

**Zurkhwood**: This giant mushroom can reach a height of 30 to 40 feet. Its large spores are edible with proper preparation, but zurkhwood is important primarily because its stalks are hard and woody. Zurkhwood is one of the very few sources of timber (or anything like it) in the Underdark, and many items that would be crafted from wood in the surface world are fashioned from zurkhwood in the Realms Below.

See [[For My Players, On the Underdark]] for another list of known flora.

### Torchstalks

These non-magic mushrooms have combustible, long-burning caps. The caps are hard to light, usually taking 1d4+1 minutes to ignite, but once it is lit, a torchstalk. burns steadily for 24 hours and sheds light in a 10-foot radius. These fungi grow wild in the Middledark, especially in the North, and large domesticated crops of them can be found in Gatchorof, Gracklstugh, and most dwarf settlements. Drow rarely use them because they tend to prefer magical light sources when light is needed.

One torchstalk subspecies explodes into choking spores When lit. After burning for 3 rounds, a torchstalk of this variety bursts into fiery that can choke unwary travelers. Anyone in a 20-foot radius of a torchstalk when it bursts must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A DC 18 Knowledge (Underdark local) or Survival check allows an observer to distinguish explosive torchstalks from regular ones.

#### Animal Life

The Underdark supports a surprising variety of animals. A few herbivores exist there, but most are predatory in the extreme.

Many mundane hunting animals, including bears, lions, bats, rats, and monsters of all sorts, can be found in cozy underground lairs near the surface. In deeper places, animals must shift from the surface world ecology to the Underdark ecology. Many surface creatures are ill suited for such shifts and therefore cannot be found more than a few hundred feet from a cave mouth, except for places where a surface ecology is somehow maintained in the Underdark.

**Bats**: Better adapted to a life in darkness than most other animals, bats are extremely common in the Upperdark and Middledark. Only the lowest, most inhospitable reaches are free of these creatures, and even then, monstrous varieties such as dire bats and deep bats flourish. Near the surface, these creatures are simply surface-world bats that lair in Underdark caverns. Titanic roosts that house many thousands of such creatures can be found in some spots. Lower down, most Underdark bats are fungivores or insectivores.

**Fish**: Many of the rivers, lakes, and seas of the Underdark are filled with cave fish. For the most part, such fish are small, pale, relatively inoffensive creatures. Most are blind, though some that reside in illuminated caverns may retain their eyes. In the larger bodies of water, subterranean versions of dangerous fish such as sharks may be found. Cave fish need something to eat, of course, so isolated lakes don't support cave fish populations unless they're large enough to support plant life that can survive in absolute darkness.

**Lizards**: The Underdark is home to a variety of lizards, ranging from the poisonous spitting crawler to the wild varieties of pack lizards and riding lizards. Some are fungivores; others are dangerous hunters that can easily make a meal out of a human. Domesticated giant lizards are commonly used as beasts of burden and mounts in drow and duergar settlements.

**Rothé**: These grazing, muskoxlike creatures are well adapted Lfor life in the depths. Subsisting on fungi, moss, lichen, and almost anything else that grows in the Underdark, rothé are highly valued by most Underdark races and often kept in large corral-caverns.

**Vermin**: Perhaps the most common of all Underdark creatures are vermin. The versions native to the Realms Below range from mundane creatures the size of a mite to Gargantuan spiders and centipedes. Many, such as giant beetles and cave crickets, are fungivores, but varieties of deadly hunting vermin such as spiders and scorpions also infest the depths. The Underdark races keep some of the edible ones (mostly beetles or crickets) as livestock of a sort, but few vermin are palatable, and the giant sort are simply too dangerous to keep.
