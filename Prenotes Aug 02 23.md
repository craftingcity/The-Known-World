### Intro

==ASSURE CORRECT LEVELS==

When last we left our heroes, darkness struck; each of you fell unconscious minutes after placing gold upon your eyes, but coming to your senses, you can see! You smell seaweed, salt, algae, brine. The soup of the ocean. You feel wet - slick and cold against the stone beaches. Surveying your immediate surroundings, you see water, from horizon to horizon, broken by the land you stand on. Behind you, the beach ascends into hills of grey ash, dotted by thin patches of bright orange grass. 

You do not know what day it is, though the temperate air suggests that Spring is still with us. 

### What does the World Know?

We're coming back from the Abyss, specifically Thanatos, and we know that Kalariel is with the party; he's under Suggestion, and has been for 3 hours. ("I want to see the Council of Mages.")

They are very near [[Kakurak's Lair]] and the [[Enlitte Ambonas#C15. Frost Giant Haven]], and generally the sea caves. Please use the generator to create a few could-be locations that they can run into on their way back into "civilization".
