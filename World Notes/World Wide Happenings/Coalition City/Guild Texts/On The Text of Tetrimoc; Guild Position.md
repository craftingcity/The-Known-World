"It is the official guild position that the text "[[Tetrimoc's Journal]]" is a legitimate work of an ancient dragon and is therefore a protected holy text by and for the people of the "Tetramocal Congregation" organization."

"While the text omits many features of the "outside world", it is by all accounts a legitimate work of a dragon. Given its age and the collective lack of knowledge of Ancient Draconic, few scholars can agree on the actual text of the work, but the official guild recognized holy text is the "[[Tetrimoc's Journal]]" translation."
