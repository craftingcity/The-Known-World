# The Grey Ordeal

A group of adventurers that had a powerful impact on this world.

They formed in 74 AF, when they began to do small tasks for an [[The Old Man]], whose name has been lost to time.

They became local heroes, defeated a local monstrocity, took a small break, recoalesed when the Old Man called for them and fought the demon Orcus, Prince of the Undead and held him at bay.

In 93 AF, they settled down and put focus on the efforts of the [[Guilds]]

Members include:
[[Tubric Millstone Wrinsmith]]
[[Eledrathil Greystone]]
