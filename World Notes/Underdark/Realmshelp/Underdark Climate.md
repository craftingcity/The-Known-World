### Climate

The temperature underground varies depending on the depth and the presence of geothermal features, but the vast majority of the Underdark has a moderate temperature throughout the year. It tends to be on the clammy and chilly side, but typical adventuring garb is sufficient to keep characters warm and dry.

**Cold Water**: Water is almost always dangerously cold in the Underdark, since it is never warmed by sunlight. A character who becomes soaked in cold water is much more vulnerable to cold conditions than a dry character. Moderate temperatures are treated as cold temperatures for the purpose of determining whether the soaked character suffers cold damage (see [Cold Dangers](https://www.realmshelps.net/adventuring/environment.shtml#cold)). This vulnerability remains for 2d4 hours or until the character changes into dry clothes; soaked clothing provides no protection.

A character who remains immersed in cold water for more than 1 minute takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per additional minute of immersion.

**Geothermal Heat**: Caverns heated by geothermal activity can be quite warm; in fact, hot or severe temperatures are common near volcanoes. Any chamber with exposed magma is severely hot, and possibly extremely hot (see [Heat Dangers](https://www.realmshelps.net/adventuring/environment.shtml#heat)).
