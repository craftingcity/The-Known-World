# Description
Ungaethram is a name twofold. It names the capital city of the Lolth Drow and the vault that city resides in. The entrances to the vault have been curated by its inhabitants; there are a half dozen "horizontal" entrances and only four "vertical" entrances. These points are heavily monitored and often guarded. 

The city itself is a sprawling growth of beautiful elven architecture centered around a massive pillar carved into the shape of their Goddess, the Spider Queen, Lolth.

Much of the vault is light by the glowing red of the fey-beetle that live in this space. They are cast from the city proper wherever possible - they are a menace to food and textiles - where instead the drow favor the glow of dull blue; most of the estates have purchased the House Barrison Del'Armgo's lighting solution, the everlight brazier. They only sell it in blue. 
## Physicality of the Holding
Towering stone buildings stand above the ramshackle barrelstalk constructions that make up the most of the Ungaethram. The [[Ungaethram Drow Houses#The Upper Third|upper thrid]] each have a tower in Ungaethram, but the rest of the houses make due with whatever they can build and buy. 
## Population Distribution
Nearly 7/10th drow, and then 1/20th each of dwarves, gnifrblin, goblins, kuo-tao, human, and small collections of the other races.

## Defenses
Each of the main gates to the city are guarded by no less than 30 fighters. Groups of 8 coodinated by House Oblodra patrol for two days travel around the city.

## Notable Locations
Including both locations in the holding and around it, such as "the cave three miles southwest" or "Jimmy's potion shop in the Foire District"...
