# Description
Ungaethram is a name twofold. It names the capital city of the Lolth Drow and the vault that city resides in. The entrances to the vault have been curated by its inhabitants; there are a half dozen "horizontal" entrances and only four "vertical" entrances. These points are heavily monitored and often guarded. 

The city itself is a sprawling growth of beautiful elven architecture centered around a massive pillar carved into the shape of their Goddess, the Spider Queen, Lolth. 

The city's neighborhoods - and at the same time, the [[Ungaethram Drow Houses|Noble House's]] Estates - are visibly different in both style and class from one another. Some estates are massive, the largest of which is alone one of the largest population centers you have ever seen, rivaling Coalition City. In comparison, the estates that claim only one house or two are only worth mentioning for their quantity in the hundreds.

The edges of the vault are light by the glowing red of the fey-beetle that live in this space. They are cast from the city proper wherever possible - they are a menace to food and textiles - where instead the drow favor the glow of a dull blue; most of the estates have purchased the House Barrison Del'Armgo's lighting solution, the everlight brazier. They only sell it in blue. 


## Population Distribution
Nearly 7/10th drow, and then 1/20th each of dwarves, gnifrblin, goblins, kuo-tao, human, and small collections of the other races.

## Defenses
Each of the main gates to the city are guarded by no less than 30 fighters. Groups of 8 coodinated by House Oblodra patrol for two days travel around the city.

## Notable Locations
Including both locations in the holding and around it, such as "the cave three miles southwest" or "Jimmy's potion shop in the Foire District"...

# Politics
## [[Ungaethram Drow Houses#The Upper Third|"The Upper Third"]]
The upper third is a group of 18 powerful drow families that wield the most power in Ungaethram. For the most part, their interactions decide the fate of Ungaethram. To help visualize the ongoings of the city, each house is given a number representing its relative power to the other top houses. In total, there is 90 "political power" among the top 18 Houses in the city. There is 10 distributed among the countless Lesser Houses.
