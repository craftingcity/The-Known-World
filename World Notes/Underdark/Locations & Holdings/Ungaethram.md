# Description
Ungaethram is a large drow city in a [[Underdark Travel Table#Entering a New Space|gigantic vault]]
## Physicality of the Holding
Towering stone buildings stand above the ramshackle barrelstalk constructions that make up the most of the Ungaethram. The [[Ungaethram Drow Houses#The Upper Third|upper thrid]] each have a tower in Ungaethram, but the rest of the houses make due with whatever they can build and buy. 
## Population Distribution
Nearly 7/10th drow, and then 1/20th each of dwarves, gnifrblin, goblins, kuo-tao, human, and small collections of the other races.

## Defenses
Each of the main gates to the city are guarded by no less than 30 fighters. Groups of 8 coodinated by House Oblodra patrol for two days travel around the city.

## Notable Locations
Including both locations in the holding and around it, such as "the cave three miles southwest" or "Jimmy's potion shop in the Foire District"...
