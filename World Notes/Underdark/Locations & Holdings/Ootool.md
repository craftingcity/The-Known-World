# Description
The "city" of Ootool, so it is called, is alive. It is the city and its inhabitants, the fungal growth spreading through the Underdark dying and growing and so slowly moving - and only if it is suited. Fables declare Ootool to be infinite in its wisdom, and it journeys for decades if and when necessary.
