# Description
The "city" of Ootool, so it is called, is alive. It is the city and its inhabitants, the fungal growth spreading through the Underdark dying and growing and so slowly moving - and only if it is suited. Fables declare Ootool to be infinite in its wisdom, and it journeys for decades if and when necessary.

> *Why did Ootool abandon the [[Great Abadon Lake]]? It had made itself comfortable there for decades, and left in only few months! Soon the others understood - their Great Lake had been infested with bad meat upstream! They could not drink. Then the bugs came. I will spare you the end of this tale, for our horrors are our own.*

Ootool is a large slowly shifting fungal city. It takes years for it to move more than a few yards - if it wants to move at all.

## Population Distribution
Most of the population of Ootool is non-humanoid fungals. Some humanoids reside in Ootool, some of which are fungal.

## Defenses
Ootool is capable of defending itself with spores if necessary, but it is mostly reliant on its inhabitants for protection.

## Notable Locations
Ootool currently resides in an area of ancient power and current plot significance. It would be useful for Ootool's area to be well defined.

Two portions are maintained by the Scale Clan of trogladytes who travel with Ootool and defend it while reaping their reward - multicolored fungal scales. These are greatly important to their culture.

- Temple White - the chamber of white stump, blue scale. cave bungalos house competitors for the white scale.
- Temple Blue - the chamber of blue stump, brown scale. cave bungalos house competitors for the brown scale.
- Temple Brown - the chamber of brown stump, blue scale. cave bungalos house competitors for the blue scale.
- The Climb - a large stairwell that connects the upper trogladyte temples with each other and the lower bowels of Ootool

One portion is maintained by a group of mutated humanoids. They call eachother Servitors. Each sports a fungal growth from an orifice of theirs.

- Largegate - a large black gate smack dab in the middle of the servitor territory, **to be avoided**
- Housing - dozens of large toadstools are used as houses for the Servitors
- Feeding Growths - large farms in the lower vault of the Servitor's territory

Three central portions are maintained by a group of fungaloids. They do not welcome outsiders, but will gladly work with them for mutual gain.

- Tunnel Maze - a defense for non-hivemind-oids, a complex maze, easily navigated with hivemind assistance.
- Central Stalks - the core mind of Ootool
- Regrowth Chamber - a large chamber for the specific purpose of regrowing portions of damaged fungaloids.
- Gathering Hall - a chamber for the Atriarch of Ootool to hold ceremony. also connected to [[Whitimore's Last Hold]].
- Gallery - a garden of hundreds of beautiful flora.
