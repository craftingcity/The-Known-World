# Description
The "city" of Ootool, so it is called, is alive. It is the city and its inhabitants, the fungal growth spreading through the Underdark dying and growing and so slowly moving - and only if it is suited. Fables declare Ootool to be infinite in its wisdom, and its journeys for decades if necessary.

> *Why did Ootool abandon the [[Great Abadon Lake]]? It had made itself comfortable there for decades, and left in only few months! Soon the others understood - their Great Lake had been infested with bad meat upstream! They could not drink. Then the bugs came. I will spare you the end of this tale.*

> [[Flaker, Ootool Servicer]], when asked about Ootool's quickest moments.

Ootool is a large slowly shifting fungal city. It takes years for it to move more than a few yards - if it wants to move at all.
