# Description
The "city" of Ootool, so it is called, is alive. It is the city and its inhabitants, the fungal growth spreading through the Underdark dying and growing and so slowly moving - and only if it is suited. Fables declare Ootool to be infinite in its wisdom, and it journeys for decades if and when necessary.

> *Why did Ootool abandon the [[Great Abadon Lake]]? It had made itself comfortable there for decades, and left in only few months! Soon the others understood - their Great Lake had been infested with bad meat upstream! They could not drink. Then the bugs came. I will spare you the end of this tale, for our horrors are our own.*

Ootool is a large slowly shifting fungal city. It takes years for it to move more than a few yards - if it wants to move at all.

## Population Distribution
Most of the population of Ootool is non-humanoid fungals. Some humanoids reside in Ootool, some of which are fungal.

## Defenses
Ootool is capable of defending itself with spores if necessary, but it is mostly reliant on its inhabitants for protection.

## Notable Locations
Ootool currently resides in an area of ancient power and current plot significance. It would be useful for Ootool's area to be well defined.

Two portions are maintained by the Scale Clan of trogladytes who travel with Ootool and defend it while reaping their reward - multicolored fungal scales. These are greatly important to their culture.

- Temple White
- Temple Blue
- Temple Brown
- The Climb

One portion is maintained by a group of mutated humanoids. They call eachother Servitors. Each sports a fungal growth from an orifice of theirs.

- Largegate
- Housing
- Feeding Growths

Three central portions are maintained by a group of fungaloids. They do not welcome outsiders, but will gladly work with them for mutual gain.
