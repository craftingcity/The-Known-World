*Under the Gathering Hall*

Under the Gathering hall, the Mycosynth roots of Ootool reach deep and drink from the river. This grounds houses a temple. Many permanant and non-permanant structres surround the temple, flowing even across the river. This encampment looks like it could house and, noticing the fishing nets and curated berry bushes, feed some dozen humanoids.

Outside the temple, three teams of twelve work and live.

*Inside the Last Hold*

The inside of the temple is too old to be recognizable, the stone barren of any marking and slick with wet growth.

The temple interior has been converted to an operations center.

The undertemple is honorable housing. The 

The catacombs is for prisoners, and contains a secret saferoom with a scoll of delay blast fireball and a black chain of *planeshift to the plane of fire*. if things go bad :).
