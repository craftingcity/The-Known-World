# Thieves
The Thieves follow [[The Code of Thieves]]. By all following these simple ideals, they  

Three "teams" of thieves have become very well established, and fight against each other and the four or more nomadic collectives for the few and far between resources in the desert. The "teams" are each named after and headed by a "team captain" who has proven themself in their own way. Currently, the three teams are lead by [[Agrandica]], [[Barthalmule]], and [[Cobalt]].

Food, water, and medicine are primary concerns, while ammunition and weaponry are secondary. Raw resources such as wood, stone, and metal are tertiary, as the Thieves rarely make - preferring to maintain - permanent structures.

The thieves husband Camels and raise them for war. Each team has perhaps 50 trained camel to use at their disposal across each of their bases.

## Weaponry
The thieves have a cultural disposition against death or taking the life of another. Generally, they use blunted weaponry and ammunition, but some of the more powerful members carry and use [[Durandurm Weaponry]].

# Nomad Tribes
The nomadic tribes of this area are, like thieves, forceful with their resource gathering, but unlike the thieves, few live to tell their tales. Food is a scarcity in the desert, and unlike the Thieves, the nomads do not grow and steal their food, but rather opt to eat whatever they can catch.

Many people in [[The Golden City]] tell tales of the cannibalistic nomads of the outlands and, while meant to be exaggerated, most are true.

## Weapons
The nomads do not share the thieves cultural value on life. They generally use their natural weapons or bladed weaponry, finishing off and removing their prey before fleeing to consume it or continuing to fight for their lives, home, and resources.
