# Prime's Grand [Timeline](https://github.com/George-debug/obsidian-timeline)

## The Age of Beginning
The recorded history begins with [[Tetrimoc's Journal]].
```timeline-labeled
date: 000AF
title: The Fall
content: 

[[Tetrimoc]] falls, the timeline begins. The #goblinoid people have been here for as long as they can remember. They have known this land in the time before its becoming.

Humans wake in the fields. [[Dwarves Specifics|Dwarves]] become carved from stone, the first story of a [[Halfling Specifics|Halflings]] is told. The [[Elves Specifics|Elves]] say they've lived childhoods in another place, and their knowledge shows it. Soon Dwaves find the nomadic [[Goliath Specifics|Goliath]] wandering their mountians, some [[Gnome Specifics|Gnomes]] trundle in. It will be some years until the first [[Dragonborn Specifics|Dragonborn]] will be born, but many other "exotic" races such as [[Kenku Specifics|Kenku]] and [[Tiefling Specifics|Tiefling]] place their origin stories around this time as well.

Each of these new people brought something with them, some knowledge, technique, concept, culture. 

Quickly, cultures began to respect or fear those that could manipulate the Weave. There were [|those] that used it selfishly, and they were called evil, and [The Wizard in Blue|those] that used it for the benifit of others, and they were called good.

In the eyes of [[Its Greatness]], [[The Old|the elven city of Minyostalma]] was unworthy. It was burned.

Nations are clear now. The [[50 Year White Burning]] has ended and the [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]] has taken control of the northwest. With [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] becoming an imperial powerhouse in the northeast, small skirmishes between the Combine and Prosper leads to a minor war.

date: 078AF
title: The Coalition and the Democratic Combine of Peoples is Formed
content:

[[The Grey Ordeal]] unite the nations for peace and cooperation given the limited resources available. A city is created in the center of the nations under the (perhaps unimaginitive) name [[Coalition City]]. For the next decade, this is where the nations struggle for power. [[The Guilds]] make sure nothing gets out of hand, but are weakened by animosity between the nations (see [[Politics of Coalition c. 078AF - 092AF]] for a written account).

While the demons were foiled, they were not destroyed. The Hells will strike again, in a long time. 

date: 092AF
title: The Great Retirement
content:
![[alaturmen-100AF.png]]

[[The Grey Ordeal]] disbands, focusing on their domestic work in [[The Guilds]] or their other affairs. Under their watch, a great prosperity engulfs the lands, and this age of beginning ends. 

[[Tetrimoc]] no longer is a visible leader of his flock (as such his journal is widely distributed by scribes), and the [[Golden Claws]] become the driving political power of [[The Lands of Tetrimoc]].
