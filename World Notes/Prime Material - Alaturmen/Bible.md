> I live in a place of many wonders. The land shifts in front of our eyes. I would not believe it if I could not see it. Your magic would look pale in comparison [[Uncle Greystone|Uncle]]. Others have found us, and we work together; but something is not right. You said we were the first people here, but you were wrong. 
> \- [[Eladrithal Greystone]]

## The World is Young
The goblinoids lived without time; hunting, gathering, and supposedly swimming in primordial soup. Then, "the Immortal Yellow Dragon, the Great Tetrimoc" fell from the sky, cut himself on a [[Kailkeep|rock]], and hid in a hid in a hole. Finally; everyone else came too. Elves born from Eladrin parents traveled here, carved the first dwarves from the stone, told the first legends of halfling, found the first humans lying naked in their fields. The elves claim to be first to find many of the other peoples too, but they always lay claim to too much. 

History began for these new people with the fall of [[Tetrimoc]]. The elves say that this place was made for him to fall to, this is the truth, so much as it was what they were told by their parents. 

[[Tetrimoc's Journal]] is a ancient document that records this time; it is like a word of god to some. For this reason, people record this era's years with the moniker AF, meaning after fall. Assuredly, some other grand event will cause their successors to change the convention.

In the first years, these two peoples were weary and cautious. They both had little information of each other and their intentions. This tension was broken by the young Arthur Simonson as he fought for justice against the tyrants of the human and goblin settlements in the Northeast. Largely due to this act, the humanoid people live in relative harmony with the goblinoid people, and for many, their societies have completely intertwined.

## Geography

At the edge of the land, the common folk will tell you to venture no further. They are right to warn you. Some magic breaths in this world. The Weave grows and shrinks the world to its whims. When people go too far, they do not come back. Unless you speak of [[Eladrithal Greystone]], but that is another tale.

### Northeast
In the Northeast, as I have spoken of, are dense forests and open plains, rolling hills connecting the lot. The common folk of this world call this quarter of the world either simply "the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories|Territories]]" or "[[The Kingdom of Prosper]]". 

Most of the goblinoid inhabitants that do not actually live within the Kingdom of Prosper (and especially the ones that are in an open war against it) perfer "the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories]]". 

Most of the humanoids that live there would prefer the latter however, as most of them actually do live in Arthur's Kingdom.

### Northwest
In the northwest lie [[The Holy'lnds]]. In the first years of this world, a [[Its Greatness|great white flame]] burnt the whole of the northwestern fourth of the world. It stopped before the mountains of the desert and it burnt deep into the great northern forests. Few people or structures survived. Then, it stopped, pulled back, and the people flooded into its arms. They now worship this fire, for it allows itself to be contained in their braziers and hearths.

### Southwest
In the Southwest, a vast desert stretches from the mountains on its northern edge to the great [[Alavini River|Alavini]] river that flows along eastern. Most of this desert is known as [[The Outlands]], where bands of thieves and nomads are left to roam and steal. In the desert's heart [[The Golden City]] stands tall. Opulent and Imperial, this city is home to most of the business that goes on in the desert, even much of the thievery that occurs in the Outlands has a central line of communication to and from the city. 

### Southeast
In the southeast, a great amount of water lays upon the land, making much of the earth wet and swampy. This is very useful for growing food, which is much of what occurs in the [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], but the people of this land make war among themselves here too.

Unlike the other nations of this world, the Democratic Combine is less a united government and more a universal legal system. The many that use the Combine as their system make war against eachother over resource, but will fiercely and effectively defend each other from "outside" attacks. 

### [[Coalition City]]
Standing, carved into the center of the largest mountains at the eastern end of the [[Desert's Range]], a grand metropolis was born out of the need for communication and peace among the peoples of this world. The city is split into nine wards, each of which may as well be a city upon itself.
Each of the wards has a purpose that allows the greater city to prosper, and some even have purpose for the world at large.

[[The Guilds]] are a respected group of people who hold roles in the world at large. They are often respected and honored guests of the nations that host them, creating a connected network of Wizards, Merchants, Craftsfolk, and the like.

## Big Notes from the World
Coalition City is the biggest up-and-coming power in the world. The Kingdom and the Church have some contention, as they are both militarily strong, but neither could survive attacking the other at this time. The Kingdom and the Combine are in a similar holding pattern, but the military power of the Combine is much more guerrilla than outright warpower. Noone dares threaten the Lands of Tetrimoc, even with his recent disappearance.

The places to learn or study would be the Wizards of the world. They hold the knowledge that must be kept for our continuation.

Legend tells of many dangers in between the civilized lands. Beasts and Terrors hold just upon the edges of civilization, wearing away. 

Much of the treasure of the world is held in horde, still yet to be plundered, but a handsome price some may pay for a job done well.

Most people use barter to trade for resources, as most people do not carry minted coin, but coin and merchant bar is acceptable currency nearly anywhere. The Kingdom of Prosper has a large treasury, and has spread coin around the world, making it the dominant currency, but each of the "nations" of the world mint their own coin.

The people of the world have [[The Worldwide Calander Systems|different names]] for the days of the week and months of the year, but they all use a 7 day week and a 52 week year.

Travel from one side of the world to the other takes a month. Crossing a nation takes roughly a week. Travel is easy, but unrefined.

The most common languages spoken are Desertspeech, High Common, King's Common, and Swampish. They are all born of the languages of the humans and elves, often with historical language of the goblins, dragons, eladrin, and triton.

## Power and Punishment
There are four "national" level powers, the church, the kingdom, the immortal dragon (but mostly [[Golden Claws]]), and the united forces of [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], one lower power regulatory federal system, and a few regional powers that are not a part of the national contest (yet). Church is theocracy, Kingdom is united fellowship monarchy, the Claws use fear, and the Combine uses strength and community.

Execution is a common punishment for serious crimes such as treason or murder, but most people are subject to fines more than anything else. 
## Daily life 
Most people live life knowing of "the magic all around us", but not seeing much of it. There are legends of arcanists, but the local engineer works the most magic around town. Water power, some plumbing, and a few techno-magic items are raritys in the world but they exsist.

The most common profession is farmer. Then thief. Then "adventurer" or "realm defender". People of the realm keep an open mind for the most part. Commoners fear the many dangerous monsters that plague the lands, and seek protection from those powers that be. They want peace and security. 

## Magic, gods, and the planes 
Magic is a mystery. Some try to solve it. Some use it freely. It is both respected and feared, as it has immense power. One can acquire magic in exchange. It never comes freely. 

Items enchanted and spellbound are rare, hard to create, harder to find. Few exist outside of hoards of dragons and wizards.

The main faiths of the world serve powers on the plane; [[Its Greatness]] and [[Tetrimoc]]. There are some bards and clerics that worship the hard emotions of being a people, and other people worship some patron of need. Gods rarely interfere. 

The planes are fluid. The outside leaks in here, and some guild scholars say that we can push back too. Some people try, foolishly.
