Let me tell you a story...

# In the Beginning
There was nothing. And then for a moment and forever, the goblins thrived. Right after that, one single moment later, [[Tetrimoc]] split the heavens of Alaturmen and threw himself down unto it. There he was given his first wound by the lone mountain known know as Kailkeep.

## Preamble
Kailkeep is a massive complex dug by a fanatical group of Kobold and other monsters for two main purposes; first, the safety of themselves, and second, the torment of others. These kobolds are wicked and crafty, they rule this massive complex, even stronger monsters respect them as the true keepers of Kailkeep. Except one, with whom the collective of kobold work as equal: Terra, the Idol of Earth. Why Terra began to work with them, I would dare not ask, but she has become as horrible as they are.
