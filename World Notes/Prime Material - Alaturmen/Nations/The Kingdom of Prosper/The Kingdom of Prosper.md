# The Kingdom of Prosper
Not but 45 years have passed since the [[Arthur Simonson|Great Adverturer King]] united the lands. The city of [[Yerba]] is the largest city in the Kingdom, second only to the [[Castle Prosper]] and its surrounding municipality. Many other small collectives blot the land (such as the farming community of [[Moonlight]]), connected by poorly kept cobbled roads. Much of the geography of Prosper is forested. 

## History
For much of the first century, "The Kingdom of Prosper", it was an idea in a young hobgoblin's head. 

In the very beginning, people made homes and farms here, and quickly the [[Bandit Lords]] came. They ruled with force, and took over the small settlements that existed. They fought against the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories#Clans|Blood Clans]] and took land from the hobgoblins to make their own holdings larger. 

In [[Prime Timeline|56AF]], [[Arthur Simonson]] united these lands in a civil war that many call the [[Unification]]. It was a war against the [[Bandit Lords]] that had ruled this area. In the end, it was a great success for the people of Prosper. As each holding swore fealty to their new king, they were adorned a [[Nobles of Prosper|Noble House]] name.

## Government
The Kingdom of Prosper is a monarchy, headed by the great [[Arthur Simonson]], and enforced by his standing army.

The population pay taxes to maintain the cities and kingdom operations, but much of the new or temporary projects are funded by Simonson's hoard, leading to generally low taxes for the people of Prosper. Arthur has a team of accountants that work together with the [[Guild of Merchants]] and [[Guild of Crafters]] to budget for the whole of the kingdom.



## Population Distribution and Language
The common language in Prosper is known as "the [[King's Common]]" and is based majorly on the languages of Humans, Goblins, and Elves. 

Population distribution is as follows; one may...
- large swaths of the "races of men", such as humans, halflings, dwarves
- large swaths of elves
- commonly find the "monstrous races", such as gnoll, bugbear, goblin
- rarely the "exotic races" such as dragonborn, goliaths, tiefling, kenku, triton
- rarely feyborn, such as eladrin
