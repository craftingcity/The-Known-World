For a long time, this land was untouched. Not uninhabited, but it lacked the flare that [[Its Greatness]] provides. In [[Prime Timeline|025AF]], [[Its Greatness]] spread across [[The Holy'lnds]] and claimed it for its new world. Those that it deemed unworthy were immolated. Many people fled or died. Most people who lived in [[The Old]] are gone now.
