In the year of 102AF, a group of Giants gathered together with a simple plan. Travel the planes, make space in the [[The Planes of Existence|Planes]] via assaulting and enslaving the inhabitants of the Marked Plane, Alaturmen, and live there free of The Ordening. [[King Snure]] brought this plan to two other Giant leaders, The [[Jarl Grungar]] and The Chief Tymbax, and plans to spread the word of "the great migration". Stone giant groups heard, but few became interested. Cloud and Storm giant groups outright disavowed the plan. The other Frost and Hill giants looked to their peers.

"All-Father Annam is dead and gone. The others do not believe it to be so. Let us show them that the Ordening is false prophecy. We are greater together!" - [[King Snure]]

[[King Snure]] was a powerful foe who desperately wished to secure his victory. He contacted a group of Drow from the Underdark who said they could help. And they were quite helpful, even from so far away! Snure's one problem, traveling from his domain to Alaturmen they could solve - for a price.

They wished for a harmonious Underdark. Whatever that means to them. They needed much gold, they had to rebuy their kingdom they said. "Religious Differences". The Giants understood their situation and agreed to their moderate deal.

Their first move was to establish a base-camp. The Hill giants of Chief Remmishk were sent via a *mass plane shift* ritual first, as they were the most eager to join Snure and prove their loyalty. With them, aband of his explorers and the Giant himself.

[[Kakurak]] quickly heard of the Hill giants' arrival and sent a group of adventures to investigate. They were sent for the 'black chain' that Kakurak spied to be of great power; too powerful for Hill Giants to create on their own. We know this to be true, this chain was a parting gift and an escape plan for the Hill Giants if they met a powerful resistance. They were to transport to [[The Planes of Existence#Great Glacier|The Great Glacier]] and be safe there.

Kakurak's team dealt a swift blow to the giants, nearly completely exterminating them. News spread quickly to the Jarl and the King. Quickly thereafter, the team used this 'black chain' to transport themselves to the Jarl's domain in an attempt to simply convince him to stop (by [[Kakurak]]'s request). He agreed to send three envoys to Kakurak to strike a deal; the frost giants get out scott-free, no fight, we come here, make space but no trouble, and finally be free of the Ordening. The team provided a great diplomacy, and the three envoys returned to the Jarl to deliver their message. The Jarl did not find this acceptable, as he knows that fighting the Ordening on the elemental planes is a loosing battle against a superior enemy. He furthered communication with Kakurak to sponsor a holding for them on his plane. This communication is currently unresolved.

Kakurak's team was dealt a hard and unexpected blow when they were attacked by a group known as [[The Whitimores]] - a group of drow from the Underdark, who said they could help.

Snure's second wave was met with much less resistance. The Frost Giants and the Fire Giants were well equipped to attack the defence-poor humanoid settlements in the [[The Holyl'nds|northwest]].
