This is a setting written with fifth edition dungeons and dragons in mind as the main game to play, but we use elements from other games such as Dungeon World to organize this set of notes.

My touchstones are: The Hobbit, Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas, Slathbog's Gold, League of Legends (but only the good parts), Critical Role (seasons 1, 2, and 3), The Adventure Zone (balance), Dimension 20 (fantasy high, misfits and magic, tiny heist, the seven, unsleeping city)

I take a lot of my organizational tools from [Dungeon World](https://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/). I found that I wasn't great at the specifics of how to run the micro game, but the macro was very useful to me. I will be filling in my world much more than the creators intend, but that matters little. 

Often, I use #fronts to organize the dangers of a campaign.
My #holding use systems of tags that I coopt from DW.
