*The Known World c. 100AF - [[Jasper Vwem]]*

# Nations of Alaturmen
The following sections focus on what you need to know to create characters and NPCs from the nations of Alaturnmen and some of the smaller regions.

The "Four Nations of Coalition" arose some half century after [[Tetrimoc]] fell. After they rose to power, they began to interact and it became clear that a peace would be most beneficial for everyone. Together they built a "world capital" into the large end of the [[Deakred Range]].

A decent system of roads connect the nations through [[Coalition City|Coalition City]]. From [[Coalition City|Coalition City]], the [[Alavini River]] leads south, giving southern nations access to and from the city via waterway.

# [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]
**Capital:** [[Castle Prosper]]
**Hallmarks:** Art, Artifice, Grain, Forestry, Martial Prowess

In the wake of the Fall, Prosper is one of the most powerful nations in Alaturmen. It possesses abundant resources. Prosper leads the known world in industry and commerce, and holds an [[Vurdine#Vurdine Acadamy|Academy]] in [[Vurdine]]. 

While the Kingdom is a true monarchy, headed and completely ruled by his lordship [[Arthur Simonson]], it is also a [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories#Clans|Blood Clan]] under, again, [[Simonson Clan|Simonson rule]]. It is home to a few powerful noble families, many of whom have bloodline as far back as the [[Unification]].


## Interesting things about Prosper
- Some [[Nobles of Prosper]] are goblins, leading credit to the Kingdom's claim to be a legal [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories#Clans|Blood Clan]].
- Our King, [[Arthur Simonson|Artie]], is unaging, but not disillusioned. He protects his common citizen as well as he can.


## Characters from Prosper
As you develop a character from the Kingdom of Prosper, consider the following properties:

**Family Heritage.** In the kingdom, everyone comes from somewhere. Many families are not noble, and work the farms and crafting halls, but those who are landed in this society have an "a" sound before their family name; the [[Noble House a'Nyrk]]'s patriarch is the handsome goblin [[Blagur a'Nyrk]], for example. 

**Farm or Forest?.**  Did you grow up in the many farms of the southeast or in the "frontier" forests at the edge of the Kingdom's influence? Are you more comfortable in cities or open air?

**a.** a

## Cities and Sites
### [[Castle Prosper|Prosper Proper]]
The Capital of the Kingdom, Prosper proper is a keep where the king lives and works, and the City of Prosper surrounds him. Mostly noble families do business here, but the city also disperses into many fields of farmers that call the city home.

### [[Moonlight]]
Small farming communities such as Moonlight are essential to the Kingdom's economy, as they produce the food that the other folk eat. While some farming communities are friendly, Moonlight's common folk have no love for the adventure type, with some exceptions. Moonlight is home to [[Durth's Tavern]], a region renown bar, famous for its Aasimar patron and namesake who is both a great tavernkeep and non-guild adventure patron, although he has little to give but space. 

### [[Magius]]
Home to Prosper's most prestigious Acadamy, Magius is a rural "college town". Rumor has it that the King hand picks [[Magius University]] students to work for him on "kingdom secrets". 

### [[Yerba]]
A lavish city, they call this place "the City of Adventure". This is the largest city in the Kingdom, rivaling even the King's own holding. This is where the Guild Halls representing the Kingdom are based. Many merchant families got their start in Yerba, such as the Northstones of [[Northstone Trading Company]].

### [[The Independant State of Yoursvik]]
While the peace brought about by the Coalition is wonderful for some; the citizens of Yoursvik live every day under two rulers; a member of the [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]] and the [[Arthur Simonson|King Of Prosper]]. While they are legally an independant state, both nations have claim to the city and a thumb in its pie. [[Noble House a'Haruuc]] hails from this city, and holds most of it's legal power. They have, in accordance with [[Coalition's Founding Document]], left "ample room" for whomsoever of the Combine holds Yoursvik that day. [[Svik Talon]] is a group of citizens who use violence to maintain a border between the House's rule and their own. 

# [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]]
**Capital:** Unknown
**Hallmarks:** Ale, Chaos
