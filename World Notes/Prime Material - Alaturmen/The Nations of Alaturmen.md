*The Known World c. 100AF - [[Jasper Vwem]]*

# Nations of Alaturmen
The following sections focus on what you need to know to create characters and NPCs from the nations of Alaturmen and some of the smaller regions.

The "Four Nations of Coalition" arose some half century after [[Tetrimoc]] fell to Alaturmen. After they rose to power, they began to interact and it became clear that a peace would be most beneficial for everyone. Together they built a "world capital" known as [[Coalition City]] into the large eastern end of the [[Deakred Range]].

A decent system of roads connect the nations through [[Coalition City]], a project of mutual benefit sponsored by the Coalition, known as the [[Three Nation Highways]]. From [[Coalition City]], the [[Alavini River]] leads south, giving southern nations access to and from the city via waterway.

# [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]
**Capital:** [[Castle Prosper]]
**Hallmarks:** Art, Artifice, Grain, Forestry, Martial Prowess

In the wake of the Fall, Prosper is one of the most powerful nations in Alaturmen. It possesses abundant resources, strategic positioning, and a powerful leadership. Prosper leads the known world in industry, commerce, and education. 

Prosper is both a traditional monarchy - headed by [[Arthur Simonson|The Great Adventurer King]], supported and managed by the [[Nobles of Prosper]] - and a legal blood clan, according to the [[Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact]]. This is important, as these seemingly conflicting forms of governance lend Prosper authority to all cultures.


## Interesting things about Prosper
- Some [[Nobles of Prosper]] are goblins, lending credit to the Kingdom's claim to be a legal [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories#Clans|Blood Clan]].
- Our King, [[Arthur Simonson|Artie]], is unaging, but not disillusioned. He protects his common citizen as well as he can.


## Characters from Prosper
As you develop a character from the Kingdom of Prosper, consider the following properties:

**Family Heritage.** In the kingdom, everyone comes from somewhere. Many families are not noble, and work the farms and crafting halls, but those who are landed in this society have an "a" sound before their family name; the [[Noble House a'Nyrk]] for example.

**Farm or Forest?.**  Did you grow up in the many farms of the southeast or in the "frontier" forests at the edge of the Kingdom's influence? Are you more comfortable in cities or open air?

**a.** a

## Cities and Sites
### [[Castle Prosper|Prosper Proper]]
The Capital of the Kingdom, Prosper proper is a keep where the king lives and works, and the City of Prosper surrounds him. Mostly noble families do business here, but the city also disperses into many fields of farmers that call the city home.

### [[Moonlight]]
Small farming communities such as Moonlight are essential to the Kingdom's economy, as they produce the food that the other folk eat. While some farming communities are friendly, Moonlight's common folk have no love for the adventure type, with some exceptions. Moonlight is home to [[Durth's Tavern]], a region renown bar, famous for its Goliath patron and namesake who is both a great tavernkeep and non-guilded adventure's patron, although he has little to give but space. 

### [[Magius]]
Home to Prosper's most prestigious Academy, Magius is a rural "college town". Rumor has it that the King hand picks [[Magius University]] students to work for him on "kingdom secrets". The dean of the Academy, [[The Grand Archmage Alergra Barrowinch]] is a efficient and ruthless teacher and mentor.

### [[Yerba]]
A lavish city, they call this place "the City of Adventure". This is the largest city in the Kingdom, rivaling even the King's own holding. This is where the Guild Halls representing the Kingdom are based. Many merchant families got their start in Yerba, such as the Northstones of [[Northstone Trading Company]].


# [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]]
**Capital:** Unknown
**Hallmarks:** Chaos, Idol Worship, Alcohol, Bountiful Flora

The Democratic Combine of Peoples were created for the purpose of collecting the voices of the waring nation-states of the southeastern wetlands of [[Central Alaturmen]].

## Interesting things about the Combine
- The elves who came to this area of Alaturmen brought with them powerful elemental magic, imbuing the lands with Woven strength.
- Triton traveled here from the Elemental Plane of Water early in Alaturmen's history, and have shaped the language of this area to closer match their own.
- Most people know their Barons by name, face, and reputation. It is common for a Baron of Combine to hold court with *all* their subjects.

## Characters from Combine
As you develop a character from the Combine, consider the following properties:

**Warring Alliance.** In the Combine, city-states vie for power and property, but outside of the Combine, its members treat each-other as family. Does your character hold a grudge or a debt to a particular city-state?

**Wetlands.** Much of the Combine is damp if not entirely submerged. Consider that most travel by waterway throughout the Combine; What does your character do to traverse their homeland?

See [[The Fiefdoms of the Combine]].

# [[The Lands of Tetrimoc]]
**Capital:** [[The Golden City]]
**Hallmarks:** Sand, Gold, Durandurm, Fear, Authority

The lands of [[Tetrimoc]] are hot and dry. Its deserts are roamed by clans of nomadic cannibal raiders and honorable thieves. There are spare yet dense centers of civility and population, the grandest of which is [[The Golden City]].

## Interesting things about the Lands of Tetrimoc
- The lands of Tetrimoc are supposedly protected and ruled by the Legendary Now-Mortal Dragon Tetrimoc. It has been many years since another mortal has reported a sighting of this legendary dragon.
- Nearly all occurrences in these lands could be traced by cause or effect to the Golden City - even the movements of the nomadic Outlanders and the battles of Thieves.
- A rare material that captures the power of the elements known as Durandurm is exclusive to the deserts in Tetrimoc's Lands.

## Characters from the Lands of Tetrimoc
As you develop a character from the Lands of the Yellow Dragon, consider the following properties:

**Points of Civilization.** Civilization in the Lands of Tetrimoc is hard to find. What has your character had to do to survive? Do they have connections to any of the groups of the area, such as the [[Golden Claws]] or the bands of Thieves or Nomads?

**Ancestral Homeland.** The legends of Alaturmen suggest that it was Tetrimoc's decent to Alaturmen that brought nearly all humanoid life to these lands. How does your character feel about these claims? How does your character treat the foreign folk that come to pay their respects to this legend?

# [[The Holyl'nds]]
**Capital:** the Holy City of Kanielkiln
**Hallmarks:** White Flame, Faith, Martial Prowess, Divine Magic

The Holyl'nds were once dense with the trees and bushes of the [[Great Northern Forests]], but the mysterious [[Its Greatness|White Flame]] caused [[Great Fires]] that changed the landscape drastically. Where once there stood the beginnings of a beautiful elven civilization, [[The Church of the White Flame]] makes civilization from wasteland and faith.
