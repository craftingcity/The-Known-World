# The Material Plane
## Prime
The Prime Material Plane (known to its population as Alaturmen, a name given to it by the [[Eladrin Specifics|Eladrin]]) expands with the ebb and flow of the Weave. It grows and shrinks as it desires to. This is a process that takes many years, and begins with sentient creatures exploring and quickens with mapping of the "film layer" in between [[#Prime]] and other planes. This is known as the [[#In Between]] to scholars studying the subject.

As an effect of this mechanic, a commoner can walk into [[#The Wildlands]] end up in their desired plane of existence, and never be seen again.

## Mirror Planes
So called "Mirror" planes of our [[#Prime]] plane exist. Some such include the [[Feywild]] and the [[Underdark]].

# The [[Wildlands]]
## General
The [[Wildlands]] is the name that the people of [[#Prime]] give to the areas beyond their ability to return from. 

## In Between...
The Ethereal plane acts as the beach of the Astral Sea. One walks too far into the [[#The Wildlands]] and things become strange; long and stretched, real but dreamlike. Seeing these affects means that one has passed beyond Alaturmen and into the Wildlands Ethereal - it is too far to turn back.

## The Astral Sea
The Astral Sea is a great pink soup of mass and energy. It is visually similar to the concept of "floating islands", but the physical space of this plane is malleable via thought alone. This plane bends to its inhabitant's will.

If one has no destination in mind or loses that destination while traveling the Ethereal, one would end up in the Astral Sea. 

Many chose or are born into living their lives in this great Sea; some become thought pirates, others great information gatherers, others still attempt to live a simple peaceful life. 

## Planeswalking

Walking the planes and ending up where you want to be is possible, but very difficult. One must maintain concentration on the destination during the entire trip, including during rest. While Planeswalking, every day, roll 1d12. On a roll of 12, present the players with an encounter. After a combat, the players must make a Constitution check, the DC of which is based on how many hit die they have (24 - remaining hit die). Planeswalking from the edge of the [[#Prime]] to a [[#Mirror Planes]] takes 1d4 x 4 days, to [[#The Elemental Planes]] takes 2d4 x 6 days, and to any of [[#The Outer Planes]] takes 3d4 x 8 days. Half of these days are spent in the [[#Prime]]'s border ethereal and the other half is spent in the destination plane's. At the end of this trip, the characters will find themselves deposited in the plane of their choosing, or if they failed to their concentrations, [[#The Astral Sea]].
