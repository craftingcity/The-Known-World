The Wildlands...
What to say...

Much of what needs to be said has been, in [[The Planes of Existence]] and [[The Rambleon]].

To you and me, The Wilds are simply the outside of the Prime plane. 

From the perspective of a commoner, it is the evil forest at the edge of town that you never let your kids explore, the long fog that hurts to breathe, the twisted rocky paths pulling the wrong way.

From the perspective of [[Rangers]], it is much the same. "We know that the land fights to come inside, so we defend with our continued presence. We can make small expeditions before becoming lost, usually within a league (18 miles / 3 hex / "a day's travel"). Within a mile of the borderposts, physicality begins to mix with weave, and within a half-league, the landscape is unique enough that non-rangers have great trouble navigating back."
