Draconic is the language of dragonkin. It is ancient, and holds as much Woven power as the languages [[Celestial]], [[Abyssal]], and [[Infernal]].

Because true-dragon have no lips, certain sounds that a human could make are omitted from its phonology, including *p* in "put", *b* in "but", *m* in "maybe", *f* in "fish", and *v* in "valedictorian".
