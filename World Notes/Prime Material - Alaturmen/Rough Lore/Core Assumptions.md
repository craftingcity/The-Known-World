# Core Assumptions

This is a list of comparable elements to the first section of the DMG's first chapter; A world of your own - Core Assumptions

## Gods are Ideas

The gods of this land exist only because the people believe they do or because someone is powerful enough to act as one. [[Sune]] is a wonderful example of this; she exists as a manifestation of the love that humanoids feel for each other, if love disappeared from the world, so too would [[Sune]]. Worship creates gods, gods do not create worship.

## Much of the World is Yet to Be

The mechanics of The Known World are such that as [[Rangers]] hold back the [[Wildlands]] and adventurers (and groups of rangers) explore it, it comes into permanence. The borders expand as people return, making pockets of the other planes come to connection and coherence with the material plane.

## The World is Young

These are the first people of a growing world, and the impact of players should be shown by the expansion of knowledge and change in borders and politics of these empires. An initial explosion of riches leaves much to be found here, but the lore of the world is still young and malleable.

## Conflict Will Shape the Path of the World

Evils want for power and will take it from those who hold it with no remorse. The current empires are all headed by good folk and as such the global conflict is kept to a minimum, but one day something is gonna threaten that peace and change it forever.

## The World is Magical

It is known as the Weave; it is all things. Its power runs through Alaturmen like its rivers. Some artisans manipulate it unconsciously. Some practitioners manipulate it consciously. Common folk consider it deadly and powerful.
