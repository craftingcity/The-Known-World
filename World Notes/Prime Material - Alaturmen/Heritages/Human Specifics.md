The progenitor humans, the 'zero generation', awoke in the fields of the northern lands of central Alaturmen circa 00AF.

Given the ingenuity and spirituality of humans, and a great deal of learning from the #goblinoid folks, humans have developed a lifespan of roughly fourty years, and a roughly twenty-five year mating cycle.

During the time of [[The Assault of the Giant Decenters]], there have been five generations;

date | generation | age
--- | --- | ---
00 AF | zero | dead, 103
~25 AF | one | dead, 68~88
~50 AF | two | most dead, 43~63
~75 AF | three | adult, 18~38
~100 AF | four | child 3~13
