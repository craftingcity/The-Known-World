## Legends from the Dwarves
Tales of the first gnomes come from the first dwarves and speak of these grand cousins of theirs.  

## Reproduction and Beyond
Gnomes are born and raised in communities of culture. Most gnomes grow up educated by their parents or some community elder or teacher.

Gnomes live for over a hundred years. Sometimes, a gnome's body will succumb to the curse of mortality before their spirit does; most often a helpful ghost in Alaturmen was, in life, a gnome.

When a gnome's spirit does "correctly" pass beyond the material planes, it is said they are retroactively reincarnated into the one force of the universe that caused their birth *and* death.
