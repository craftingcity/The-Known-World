## Legends from the Goblin
The first tales of Halfling come from the Goblin; in fact, a large portion of the halfling population on Alaturmen comes from this goblin joke:

- Who's that cousin of yours?
-- The short one or the one with sticky fingers?
- Yeah that one.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Halflings are born of tales, jest, and wonder. When someone describes some hypothetical person that does not yet exist, a halfling is formed. 

Much like dwarves, Halflings do not experience childhood. The come into the world formed from their story. 

Halfling live for about a hundred and twenty years.
