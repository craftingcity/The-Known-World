## Legends from the Dwarves
The tales of the first Goliath speak of a great dwarven feast interrupted by tribe of large stone warriors.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Goliath share the traditional sexual organs of humanoids and conceive children in multiples of twins - one pair, two pair, and such.

Goliath live for roughly eighty years. Traditional Goliath culture suggests that a goliath powerful enough passes to an arena beyond time - those who are not worthy are cast down again into Alaturmen.
