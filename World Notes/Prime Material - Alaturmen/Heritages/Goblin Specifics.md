Goblins are a #goblinoid race. This means a few things;
- They have a legitimate claim to being "here first", given that humans and elves and dwarves "came" here when [[Tetrimoc]] fell.
- They are born of planscape; giving and begetting thing one
- They are sibling to the other two #goblinoid races
