## Legends from beyond the Material Plane
Tales of "the first goblin" do not exist, goblins have been anywhere and everywhere for as long as anything has been able to think and likely long before then.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Goblins are reproduce sexually, and generally have children in multiples. A goblin's childhood entirely depends on where they grew up. Many goblins are able to happily survive in the wild, using their claws, teeth, eyes, and other abilities to their advantage. These same features get goblin children bullied in some "civilized" spaces.

Goblins live for about fifty years. Traditionally, goblins are raised for "the honorable death", but such a concept is clearly subjective, and as such could be interpreted by many cultures.

## Subspecies
"True" Goblins are short and gangly. Their ears suggest they may originate from the Feywild or before, and their eyes and claws are great perks in wilderness survival.

Hobgoblins are moderately sized. From a human perspective, "they are the most like us" in that hobgoblins remain calmer than their cousins.

Bugbear are the largest subspecies of goblin and the most animalistic. Few live in "civilized" areas, but gather together to form clans and bands.
