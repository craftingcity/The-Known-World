## Seasonal Fey
Eladrin are minor humanoid fey. They mostly inhabit the Feywild, but some have been seen in Alaturmen. They are the progenitors of the [[Elven Specifics|Elves]].

Those Eladrin that live in the Feywild are under the protection of the [[Ceilie Courts]], and although they are not very powerful fey, they have a middling position in the courts.

## Subspecies
Like their progeny, the Eladrin are seasonally influenced. 

The Spring and Summer eladrin are quite similar, and range dark in skin-tone, hair color, and eye color. 

The Autumn Eladrin are comparatively colorful, and tend to be colored brighter than their kin. 

The Winter Eladrin are mono-chromic, and have barely any color to their skin. They are often pitch black or pure white, wholly.
