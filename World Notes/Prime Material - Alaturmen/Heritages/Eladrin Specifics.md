Eladrin are minor humanoid fey. They mostly inhabit the feywild, but some have been seen in Alaturmen. They are the progenitors of the [[Elven Specifics|Elves]].

Those Eladrin that live in the feywild are under the protection of the [[Ceilie Courts]], and although they are not very powerful fey, they have a middling position in the courts.

## Seasonal Fey
Like their progeny, the Eladrin are seasonally influenced. The Spring and Summer eladrin are quite similar, and range dark in skintone, hair color, and eye color. The Autumn Eladrin are comparitively colorful, and tend to be colored brighter than their kin. The Winter Eladrin are monochromic, and have barely any color to their skin. They are often pitch black or pure white, wholly.
