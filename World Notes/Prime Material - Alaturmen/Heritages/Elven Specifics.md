## Legends from the Eladrin
The elves of Alaturmen are progeny of Eladrin. Born for this land, making it their home is the right of any adult elf born of the Eladrin.

## Reproduction and Beyond
The first generation of Elves were born 

Elves are considered young at thirty or below and reach adulthood after completing their first step in the Walk - this being their first major achievement - typically around one hundred (meaning that most elves alive are still considered children!). Most elves take their [[#Final Walk]] at around 300.

### Final Walk
Elves can live forever, if they so desire, but many elves feel a calling that is culturally known as the Final Walk. Historically, this path leads east.

Some rumor that these elves who make the walk return to their ancestors and meet their heirs at the end of time - few believe this to be true.

## Subspecies
Much like their progenitors, the elves of Alaturmen are sub-categorized by the seasons of the year.

### Spring Elves
Spring elves, also known as the Wood Elves, first came to the northeast of [[Central Alaturmen]]. There, they were unwelcome - the [[Bandit Lords]] and the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories]] both had no kindness for them. The Spring elves retreated into the forest for some time, but during the rise of [[Arthur Simonson]], the Spring Elves became an important ally for the resistance forces. After [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] destroyed the [[Bandit Lords]] and ceased hostility with [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories]], the Spring Elves migrated en-mass from the surrounding forests.

### Summer Elves
Summer Elves, also known as the Desert Elves, first came to the southwest of [[Central Alaturmen]]

### Autumn Elves
Autumn elves, also known as the High Elves, first came to the southeast of [[Central Alaturmen]], the area now known as [[The Fiefdoms of the Combine]]. There, they used their progenitor's natural magics in the battle for power and resources ever-present in the Fiefdoms. 

The traditional culture of the Autumn elves gives great respect to the Weave

### Winter Elves
The Winter elves, also known as the Drow, inherited many of the features of their progenitors. Sharp, long features, mono-chrome skin-tone, etc.

The culture of traditional Winter Elves is one of isolation and arrogance. 

Winter elves first came to the northwest of [[Central Alaturmen]], the area of the [[Great Northern Forests]] now known as [[The Holyl'nds]]]. They made peace with the goblinoids there and together, they formed the beginnings of a great nation; [[The Old|Minyostalma]]. After the [[50 Year White Burning]], the remnants of Minyostalma formed [[Cenva Minyo]].
