## Legends from the Eladrin
The elves of Alaturmen are progeny of Eladrin. Born for this land, making it their home is the right of any adult elf born of the Eladrin.

## Reproduction and Beyond
The first generation of Elves were born 

Elves are considered young at thirty or below and reach adulthood after completing their first step in the Walk - this being their first major achievement - typically around one hundred (meaning that most elves alive are still considered children!). Most elves take their [[#Final Walk]] at around 300.

### Final Walk
Elves can live forever, if they so desire, but many elves feel a calling that is culturally known as the Final Walk. Historically, this path leads east.

Some rumor that these elves who make the walk return to their ancestors and meet their heirs at the end of time - few believe this to be true.
