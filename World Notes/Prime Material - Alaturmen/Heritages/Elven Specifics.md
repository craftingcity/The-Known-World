Elves are typically born of an elven or eladrin parent and another sexual partner.

# Age
Elves are considered young at thirty and reach adulthood after completing their first step in the Walk - this being their first major achievement - typically around two hundred (meaning that most elves alive are still considered children!). Most elves take their [[#Final Walk]] at around 300.

## Final Walk
Elves can live forever, if they so desire, but many elves feel a calling that is culturally known as the Final Walk. Historically, this path leads east, along [[Deakred Range]] into [[Regal Pass]] as it is under the protection of the [[Cenva Minyo]].

Some rumor that these elves who make the walk return to their ancestors and meet their heirs at the end of time - few believe this to be true.
