## Legends from the Eladrin
The Elves of Alaturmen are progeny of Eladrin. Born for this land, making it their home is the right of any adult elf.

## Reproduction and Beyond
The first generation of Elves were formed by the [[Ceilie Courts]] and parented by groups of [[Eladrin Specifics|Eladrin]]. They were trained for and given by birthright the world of Alaturmen.

Elves share the traditional humanoid sexual organs, but their process of reproduction requires one or more of the sexual partners to produce a work of artistry directly before, after, or during the conception.

Elves are considered young at thirty or below and reach adulthood after completing their first step in the Walk - this being their first major achievement - typically around one hundred (meaning that most elves alive are still considered children!). Most elves take their [[#Final Walk]] at around 300.

### Final Walk
"True" Elves can live forever, if they so desire, but almost all elves succumb to the calling that is culturally known as the Final Walk. Historically, this path leads north out of [[Central Alaturmen]], and the elves that follow this path leave through the [[Actstow Hills]]. 

Some rumor that these elves who complete their Walk gather with their ancestors and heirs at the end of time. This is a non-elven rumor, none who Walk know what they are being called to.

## Subspecies
Much like their progenitors, the elves of Alaturmen are sub-categorized by the seasons of the year.

#### Spring Elves
Spring elves, also known as the Wood Elves, first came to the northeast of [[Central Alaturmen]]. There, they were unwelcome - the [[Bandit Lords]] and the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories]] both had no kindness for them. The Spring elves retreated into the forest for some time, but during the rise of [[Arthur Simonson]], the Spring Elves became an important ally for the resistance forces. After [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] destroyed the [[Bandit Lords]] and ceased hostility with [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories]], the Spring Elves migrated en-mass from the surrounding forests.

Traditional Spring Elf culture promotes community, kindness and enlightenment - most who think of "the good, helpful elf" would picture a spring elf.

#### Summer Elves
Summer Elves, also known as the Desert Elves, first came to the southwest of [[Central Alaturmen]]. There they met the people who came to worship Tetrimoc, and they saw their committal. The eldest Summer Elves are some of the few who could claim truly to have seen the [[Tetrimoc|Great Yellow Dragon]]. While Summer elves can be found throughout Alaturmen, a large population live in [[The Golden City]] working as [[Golden Claws]].

Traditional summer elf culture promotes impulse and fruitless joy, so long as their actions would not impede their Walk.

#### Autumn Elves
Autumn elves, also known as the High Elves, first came to the southeast of [[Central Alaturmen]], the area now known as [[The Fiefdoms of the Combine]]. There, they used their progenitor's natural magics in the battle for power and resources ever-present in the Fiefdoms. 

The traditional culture of the Autumn elves requires respect to be given to those who have spent their time mastering their skills.

#### Winter Elves
The Winter elves, also known as the Drow, first came to the northwest of [[Central Alaturmen]], the area of the [[Great Northern Forests]] now known as [[The Holyl'nds]]]. They quickly exterminated goblinoids that lived there over the course of their first year. They formed the beginnings of a powerful nation; [[The Old|Minyostalma]], but before the seeds of this nation could flower, they were [[50 Year White Burning|burned]]. After the [[50 Year White Burning]], the surviving remnants of Minyostalma formed [[Cenva Minyo]], plotting against the White Flame in the southern [[Grumbling Hills]].

The culture of traditional Winter Elves promotes cultural isolation, arrogance, and self-sufficiency.
