The Alavini River seperates the land of [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]] and [[The Lands of Tetrimoc]]. It is often home to many boats crossing up and down the river doing trade and transport. It meets the [[Deakred Range]] at [[World Notes/Prime Material - Alaturmen/World Wide Happenings 1/Coalition City/Coalition City]], the mountains' most eastern end.
