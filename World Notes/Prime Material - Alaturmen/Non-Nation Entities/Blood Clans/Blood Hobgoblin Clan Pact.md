The Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact is a #text that was written by the ancient Hobgoblins that describes the Lawful contract on which the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories]] functions. [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] is a lawful [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories|territory]], headed by [[Simonson Clan]], and as such, the rules and regulations described herein are followed.

### Imperialism

"... and it is of our nature to claim what may be ours by force and by maneuver, for no cost is too great for your sibling's child."

This is the "Imperialism" clause. It has been cited in many official war declarations between the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories#Clans|Clans]]. Most leaders understand it to mean that because of our continually growing population, we have a right to more land as we grow. It is necessary to fight for this land, and to defend our own for the sake of the family; we expect our enemies to do the same.

### Honorable Combat

"... in your heart of hearts you know that your enemies could just as soon be your brothers ... aford them the mercy you would show your brother; attack not when warriors are pregnant, sick, young, or elderly."

This is often taken as literal gospel; don't attack when these conditions are offered. Most Clans will do a pre-war ritual in line of sight of their enemies with this clause mind. Many times have these warrior parties been interrupted by a pregnant warrior entering and declaring Pact War and ending the fight immediately.
