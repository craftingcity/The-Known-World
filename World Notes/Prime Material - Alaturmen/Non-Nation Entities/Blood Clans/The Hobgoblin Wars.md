The [[Hobgoblin Specifics|Hobgoblin]] Wars begin in [[Prime Timeline|104AF]] with the assassination of [[Hobgoblin Specifics#Drubulek]] [[Tigbulg Wheernat]] of the [[Wheernat Clan]] by a young up-an-coming [[Hobgoblin Specifics#Mangugu]] [[Qiurkik Scrivin]] of the [[Scrivin Clan]]. This imposition disrupted the power structure of the [[Wheernat Clan]], leaving their defenses open, and inciting war between the two clans and the neighboring [[Bulgpim Clan]], who is using the clear opportunity to take land and resources from his neigbors, citing the [[Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact#Imperialism]] clause.
