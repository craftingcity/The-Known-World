# Cenva Minyo
## Description
The ancient order that survives [[The Old|Minyostalma]] by protecting the lore and passages of the eldest elven culture. They are currently crippled, as this militant group of spring elves does not garner much support from any of the major entities of Alaturmen.
## History
Its oldest members are the survivors of the [[50 Year White Burning]]. These elves have written and kept the stories of thousands for more than a hundred years, but like many of its earliest members, stories from before the fire have been mostly lost.

During the burning, many of the spring elves died, but the few who survived were often young. Split apart, but well trained, the survivors regrouped in the [[Actstow Hills]] before forming Cenva Minyo; swearing vengeance for their ancestors, promising power for their descendants. 

Cenva Minyo wanted to make a deal with the dwarves of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Actstow]], who inhabited the hills. They would do no deals with outsiders, they said! These young elves stood among themselves and spoke a moment before responding that they were not outsiders, but cousins once removed; the elven ancestors had in essence birthed the first dwarves after all! 

They now reside south of the [[Actstow Hills]], in the forests.

### Symbolism
A triangle - representing the first tents Cenva Minyo stayed in after the flames. Inside, at its base, stands a simply represented city - [[The Old|Minyostalma]] - above which the "sky" (upper portion of the triangle) is filled with a vertically symmetrical flame - representing their hatred for what [[Its Greatness]] has done.
