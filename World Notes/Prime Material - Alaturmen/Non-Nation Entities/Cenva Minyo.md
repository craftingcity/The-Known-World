# Cenva Minyo
## Description
The ancient order that survives [[The Old|Minyostalma]] by protecting the lore and passages of the eldest elven culture. They are currently crippled, as this militant group of spring elves does not garner much support from any of the major entities of Alaturmen.
## History
Its oldest members are the survivors of the [[50 Year White Burning]]. These elves have written and kept the stories of thousands for more than a hundred years, but like many of its earliest members, stories from before the fire have been mostly lost.

### Symbolism
A leaf-tent over a small city adorned by a symmetrical flame covering the skyline of the city.

A triangle.
