Gobliniod and Humanoid of all kinds have created a life here in Alaturmen. Presented in the order I think of them, the playable races in this section have made a noticable mark on Alaturmen's [[Prime Timeline|history]].

**Goblinoid.**
- goblin
- hobgoblin
- orc

**Humanoid.**
- human
	- the normal amount of human "races" ie 0 but like cultural identity is cool and there are some differences between groups of people but that gap is shrinking i think??
- elf 
	- winter (NW)
	- spring (SE)
	- summer (SW)
	- fall (NE)
- dwarf
	- mountain
	- hill
- halfling
- gnome
