Dwarves carve eachother out of stone. They do not have a childhood, but the many years that dwarves spend forming is similar to incubation more than childhood. 

Many Mountain dwarves grow great beards, and keep them as both a point of pride and as a useful tool to prevent chips and dust from entering their lungs during mining.

Most Hill dwarves grow beards, though most keep them short and kept, and few can even grow more than a foot long beard.
