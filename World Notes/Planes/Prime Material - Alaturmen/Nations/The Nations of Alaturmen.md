# Nations of Alaturmen
The following sections focus on what you need to know to create characters and NPCs from the nations of Alaturnmen and some of the smaller regions.

The "Four Nations of Coalition" arose some half century after [[Tetrimoc]] fell. After they rose to power, they began to interact and it became clear that a peace would be most beneficial for everyone. Together they built a "world capital" into the large end of the [[Deakred Range]].

A decent system of roads connect the nations through [[Coalition City]]. From [[Coalition City]], the [[Alavini River]] leads south, giving southern nations access to and from the city via waterway.

# [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]
**Capital:** [[Castle Prosper]]
**Hallmarks:** Cheese, Grains, Industry, Metalwork, Weapons

In the wake of the Fall, Prosper is one of the most powerful nations in Alaturmen. It possesses a large population and abundant resources. Prosper leads the known world in industry.
