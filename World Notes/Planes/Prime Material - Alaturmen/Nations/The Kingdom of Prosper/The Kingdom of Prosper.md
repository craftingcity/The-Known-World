# The Kingdom of Prosper
Not but 45 years have passed since the [[Arthur Simonson|Great Adverturer King]] united the lands. The city of [[Yerba]] is the largest city in the Kingdom, second only to the [[Castle Prosper]] and its surrounding municipality. Many other small collectives blot the land (such as the farming community of [[Moonlight]]), connected by poorly kempt cobbled roads. Much of the geography of Prosper is forested. 

## History
In the beginning, people made homes and farms here

In [[Prime Timeline|56AF]], [[Arthur Simonson]] united the lands in a civil war that many call the [[Unification]]. It was a war against the [[Bandit Lords]] that had ruled this area. 

In [[Prime Timeline|128AF]], the local Hobgoblin population erupted into civil war. [[The Hobgoblin Wars]] have yet to be resolved and have created a massive issue for Artie and the rest of the government.

## Government
The Kingdom of Prosper is a monarchy, headed by the great [[Arthur Simonson]], and enforced by his standing army.

#### Modern Politics
For much of the first century, the [[Simonson Clan]] was all there was of "The Kingdom of Prosper", it was an idea in a young hobgoblin's head. [[Arthur Simonson|Artie]] made a power vacuum, and filled it with himself. This took much time. ]
Related articles include [[Arthur's Journal]] and [[Unification]].

In the second century, contention begins to arise as the [[Northeastern Hobgoblin Territories#Clans|Blood Clans]] and the [[Nobles of Prosper]] begin to generate animosity. The Nobles want the resources that the Blood Clans have, but neither side really wants a war. The patriarch of [[Noble House a'Valim]] and the matriarch of [[Noble House a'Nyrk]] have a sick love affair and similar goals.

## Population Distribution and Language
The common language in Prosper is known as "the [[King's Common]]" and is based majorly on the languages of Humans and Elves. 

Population distribution is as follows; one may...
- large swaths of the "races of men", such as humans, halflings, dwarves
- large swaths of elves
- commonly find the "monstrous races", such as gnoll, bugbear, goblin
- rarely the "exotic races" such as dragonborn, goliaths, tiefling, kenku, triton
- rarely feyborn, such as eladrin
