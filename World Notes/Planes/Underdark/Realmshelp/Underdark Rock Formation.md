### Rocks and Rock Formations

All the topographical features of the Underdark share one thing in common: They're surrounded by rock. Rock in its various forms is every bit as relevant to the denizens of the Underdark as weather is to surface folk. Understanding the significance of different sorts of rock often means the difference between life and death for those who live in the Realms Below.

Rocks are divided into four categories: sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic, and magimorphic. These labels describe how the rock was formed. These categories of rock vary widely in their hardness, as shown below.

**Hardness** | **Rock Type**
--- | ---
6 | Sedimentary (sandstone or shale)
7 | Sedimentary (limestone)
8 | Igneous (basalt, rhyolite)
9 | Metamorphic (gneiss, granite, or marble)
x | Magimorphic rock spans a wide range of hardness, since it is often derived from the other types.

#### Sedimentary Features

Sedimentary rock formed from softer clays and deposits of organic matter long ago. These materials were compacted into discrete layers in the same sort of process that turns snow into glacial ice. Sedimentary rock is soft and easily weathered, which means that flowing water can gouge vast cave systems from it in a relatively short time, geologically speaking.

Many of the classic cave features, such as stalagmites and stalactites, are found in caves formed from sedimentary rock. Such features are called solution-based, or dripstone, formations because they form from the slow motion and evaporation of water that contains dissolved minerals.

A solution-based rock formation is considered "living" if it is still in the process of forming. With enough patience and time, the growth patterns of such formations can be shaped, although it may take dozens of years for such alterations to become evident. Some Underdark races, such as the drow and the svirfneblin, occasionally shape growing deposits into particular forms.

**Stalactite**: Mineral-laden water drips downward, creating a build-up of rock on the ceiling of a cavern.

**Stalagmite**: When mineral-heavy water drips down to the floor, the bits of rock and mineral start to pile up, creating a slowly growing protrusion on the floor.

**Column**: When a stalactite and a stalagmite meet and join, they're no longer referred to by their previous names. The resulting formation called a column.

**Cave Pearl**: Sometimes mineral-rich water drips too vigorously to form a coherent stalagmite. Where this occurs, a piece of gravel or bone might become coated with mineral deposits and polished to a round and smooth shape by the flowing water. Such an object is called a cave pearl. A well-shaped pearl with good color and texture is worth between 5 gp and 50 gp.  
Cost: 25 gp (average).

**Curtains, Draperies, and Blankets**: These terms refer to dripstone in the form of rippled, wavy, or folded sheets. Curtains and draperies are thinner, often translucent, and resonant. Blankets are thicker so they tend to muffle sound a bit. Often these features have stripes of different colors.

**Flowstone**: A layer of deposited material that follows the shape of the underlying walls or floor is called flowstone. A flowstone formation often has draperies at its lower end.

**Soda Straws**: These thin flutes, each the width of a drop of water, are how stalactites begin.

**Shield**: Water flowing through a cave wall or ceiling sometimes builds up sediment on both sides of its entry point, creating two parallel plates on either side of a thin, sheetlike crack.

**Popcorn**: This knobby, crystalline growth forms in a wide variety of cave conditions and is sometimes called cave coral.

**Boxwork**: Boxwork forms when softer rock wears away, leaving a harder crystalline network of thin blades poking out from a ceiling, floor, or wall.

**Crystal Flowers**: These crystalline formations, also called cave flowers, are valued by several Underdark races for their aesthetic beauty and their commercial value. Crystal flowers are usually made of halite (simple table salt), gypsum, or some other minerals. The petals are fibrous or prismatic crystals that resemble growing seedlings. Halite flowers often grace the table settings of wealthy drow on special occasions. Even illithids occasionally carry salt in crystal flower form to add earthy spice to their brain meals.

**Spar**: This term refers to crystal growths in which the crystal faces and structure are visible to unaided sight. Many-faceted crystals that form underwater are called pool spars.

#### Igneous Features and Rocks

Igneous features are formed or influenced by fire - usually magma chambers and flows, although openings into the Elemental Plane of Fire are not uncommon in many parts of the Underdark.

**Magma and Lava**: While molten rock is underground, it is called magma. If it erupts to the surface from a volcano, it is called lava.

**Hot Springs**: Water heated by volcanic forces often bubbles up through the ground in hot springs. Some of these springs make it to the surface; others can be found in caverns underground. Often, the water is so laden with sulfur and other minerals that it is undrinkable.

**Geyser**: A geyser consists of a deep fissure or well in which water can accumulate and be heated to high temperatures and a thin shaft that leads from this pool of superheated water to the surface. Periodically, a fountain-like jet of hot water and steam erupts from the opening. Such an eruption deals 2d6 to 6d6 points of impact damage and 2d6 to 10d6 points of fire damage to any creature it hits. The intervals of eruption can be regular or irregular.

**Lava Tubes**: These tubes form after lava has flowed from a volcano. The surface of the lava cools and solidifies while the interior is still liquid. This uneven cooling creates a crust that resembles a tube. Lava tubes can branch and fork, following the passage of the lava. Because the cooling can happen over several intervals, it's also possible to have a tube within a tube.

**Pumice**: Rock that has been made liquid and frothy hardens into a light, porous stone called pumice.

**Stalactites**: Stalactites formed by lava happen in two main ways. Tubular lava stalactites are usually formed by volcanic gases. Gas flows through lava in which different minerals are solidifying at quicker or slower rates, forming long tubes. The downward drips from such formations may form stalagmites. The second type of lava stalactite is called a sharktooth stalactite. This formation occurs when flowing lava coats existing protrusions, resulting in a broad shape that narrows to a point.

**Stalagmites**: Drip stalagmites form from material that pours off of or out of tubular lava stalactites. These puddles of lava may mound up in stalagmites.

**Spiderstone**: Drow architects use this term to refer to obsidian, which they value for its glossy black appearance. Spiderstone is frequently used in drow buildings that feature spider motifs.

**Geodes**: Often found in deserts or volcanic regions, these hollow rocks are lined with crystals. In the Underdark, some geodes are immense, growing to the size of caves. One legend tells of a wizard entombed in a 40-foot geode filled with amethyst crystals.

#### Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks occur where intense heat and pressure act to harden rock and alter its consistency. Marble is a good example of a sedimentary rock (limestone) that volcanic activity has transformed into a much harder stone. Metamorphic rock formations are similar to those of the premetamorphic rock, though often compressed. Caves formed from metamorphic rock more often take the form of faults, fissures, or similar discontinuities caused by the movement of adjacent slabs of stone.

Many metallic ore deposits form in metamorphic settings. Some valuable minerals, such as garnet and tourmaline, also form only in such environments. Hence mining-oriented cultures, such as that of the dwarves, tend to settle in areas that feature metamorphic rocks.

Since metamorphic stone is often dense, hard, and beautiful, some varieties are highly regarded as building materials. Many huge quarries can be found in the depths of the Underdark.

#### Magimorphic (magic-formed Rocks)

Magimorphic rocks are stones or rock formations that have been warped and changed by magic. The Underdark of Faer√ªn includes several very different manifestations of magimorphic rocks.

**Clear Black Rock**: In its natural state, this rock is found only in the Lowerdark, where it is cut in slave-worked quarries and prepared for export to the Middledark and Upperdark. Clear black rock is not common, but it is certainly available to those willing to pay premium prices. To regular and low-light vision, this rock looks black, shiny, and perfectly opaque, but to darkvision, it is perfectly clear. Creatures without darkvision often mistake it for obsidian, but drow, mind flayers, and other creatures gifted with darkvision find it a challenging yet worthwhile stone to incorporate into their strongholds and encampments.

**Crumblestone**: This rock breaks very easily and is the bane of miners and travelers anywhere. Crumblestone exists in a precarious equilibrium with the other rocks or strata surrounding it. A Small or larger climbing or flying creature that begins to put its weight onto crumblestone must make a DC 15 Balance check or fall when the rock beneath it turns to powder. For flying creatures, this situation rarely poses a problem, but for climbers, an encounter with crumblestone is often deadly. If enough crumblestone gives way in a cavern, a cave-in becomes likely.

**Crysstone**: Beautiful, intricate, and very delicate, crysstone is a rock that resembles spun glass. It is very hard but not at all durable (hardness 8, 2 hit points per inch of thickness). Crysstone shatters easily, and sonic damage automatically bypasses its hardness: Because it is so susceptible to sonic damage, the threat posed by monsters with Wide-area sonic attacks increases in areas where crysstone is prevalent.

**Darkstone**: Darkstone seems to drink in light. In tunnels cut through this material, light sources dim, shedding a glow only half as strong as usual. Thus, a bullseye lantern illuminates a cone only 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, while a torch lights only a 10-foot radius. A daylight spell in a darkstone area radiates daylight in only a 30-foot radius.

**Photogenerative Rock**: These rocks grow quickly when exposed to light. In each round of exposure, a photogenerative rock doubles in size until it's sixteen times as large as it was when unlit (4 rounds). Eliminating the light halts its growth, and each hour of darkness reverses the effect of 1 round of light. Some Underdark undead use photogenerative rock in their demesnes to stall light-bearing adventurers until the undead can ready their defenses. Photogenerative rock can also be used to seal a doorway and divert light-bearers into more trap-ridden or better-defended areas.

**Photostatic Rock**: Events that happen in the presence of this rock imprint upon it for a short time. One cubic foot of photostatic rock picks up impressions in a 10-foot radius and automatically relays them to anyone who touches it later. The effect is similar to that of a _stone tell_ spell, except that the photostatic property reveals only what happened within its radius in the past hour. Every additional cubic foot of photostatic rock provides 1 more hour of memory and expands the radius of sensitivity by 10 feet. A photostatic rock records only what it witnesses (treat its perspective like a burst), so it cannot record what goes on beyond a closed door.

**Quickstone**: Quickstone is the Underdark's answer to quicksand. Like many Underdark features, it's much more terrible than its surface-world equivalent. Quickstone looks like solid stone and blends into the surrounding rocks, but it functions like [quicksand](https://www.realmshelps.net/adventuring/wilderness.shtml#quicksand) except that the Difficulty Class for each maneuver increases by 5. _Transmute mud to rock_ permanently solidifies quickstone, but a success on the spell's Reflex saving throw enables a creature trapped within it to escape.

**Rock Gourds**: These rocks have been warped by long-term proximity to a portal leading to the Elemental Plane of Water. Rock gourds are rare, naturally occurring stones, not created magic items, though they register as faint conjuration magic under examination with a detect magic spell. Shaking a rock gourd causes water to dribble out. The ability of these stones to produce up to a gallon of water per day apiece makes them highly valued commodities in the Middledark and Lowerdark regions, where water is scarce.  
Cost: 500 gp. Weight 10 lb.

**Sickstone**: Sickstone glows with a nauseating, not-quite-green, not-quite-silver light that provides illumination to a radius of 40 feet. Any creature within the range of this illumination must make a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw each round or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. A successful save reduces the Constitution damage to 1 point. Anyone in physical contact with sickstone takes a -4 penalty on this saving throw, and any Constitution damage it takes becomes Constitution drain instead. The damage caused by sickstone results from a magical disease, so creatures immune to magical diseases are immune to the effects of sickstone.

**Slickstone**: This rock is very smooth to the touch. Although it is natural stone, it functions at all times as if it had a _grease_ spell cast upon it. An actual _grease_ spell cast upon slickstone has no additional effect.

#### Nonrock Tunnels

Only a newcomer to the Underdark would be naive enough to think that Toril's deep caverns are formed exclusively of rock. A variety of other materials can form the same sorts of features.

**Coral**: This "living rock" can be found in many saltwater-filled caves. Large clumps of coral often have tunnellike spaces winding through them, and aquatic creatures such as tritons sometimes use this substance as an architectural medium, building complex structures by forcing it to grow in particular patterns.

**Ice Cave**: This term refers to a cave where either seasonal or permanent ice can be found. Since there's little drinkable water in the Underdark, caves containing ide often attract settlers or predators.

**Glacial Cave**: A glacial cave is one formed entirely of ice. Such a cave provides more potential water than an ice cave, but also more potential danger. Fire and other heat sources (even body heat) might be enough to weaken or fracture the ice and start an avalanche.

**Bones**: Some areas of the Underdark have a surfeit of bones and remains of the dead. Skeletons range in size from Diminutive mice to Colossal behemoths. Moving through a section piled with skeletons means creeping or breaking through tunnels made of bones.

**Force**: Permanent walls of force are costly to create. Nevertheless, many of them exist in the Underdark. Some block off the territory of one race from another, others act as bridges across deep chasms, and still others serve no discernable purpose.

**Fungi**: Many caverns in the Underdark are full of fungus, much of it innocuous. Rather than expend the resources to hack away all of these fungi, denizens often just create routes between or through large patches of it. Tunnels cut out of mushroomlike material are not unusual sights in the Underdark.

#### Other Cave Features

Some caves are formed and shaped by eroding winds and freely flowing water, such as streams or ocean currents. The following features are common in such environments.

**Wind**: Strong or constant winds gradually shape caves and caverns. Wind effects may be present in caves that are close to the surface world, portals to the Elemental Plane of Air, or the hot gases emitted by volcanic activity. Wind-shaped caves and caverns are sometimes referred to as Aeolian caves.

**Air Pockets**: Subterranean waterways often have air above them, but the amounts vary. A lake might be housed in a vast cavern, but a swiftly moving river might have only one or two places where a swimmer might catch a gulp of air. Even more dangerous are pockets of gases other than air.

**River Canyons**: Regional uplifting of tectonic plates causes rivers to cut deep canyons. Sometimes these gorges provide surface-world entry points to the Underdark.

Subterranean rivers also create canyons. Such canyons might or might not have rivers at their bottoms now, since underground rivers often dry up or change course.

**Swirlhole**: A swirlhole is a generally circular hole in the rock of a streambed, eroded by water eddies and rubbed smooth by pebbles.

**Halocline**: The area where fresh water (such as that from a river) and salty ocean water meet is cloudy and called a halodine. Such a region often marks territorial boundaries between aquatic races.

**Sea Caves**: Seas and oceans are powerful forces that can wear the hardest of rocks down into fine sand. Tides and waterflow continuously redistribute this material.

**Tufa Caves**: Springs, rivers, and the sea can deposit a porous limestone called tufa. Finding this rock indicates that water is (or at least was) nearby.
