The Unification describes a period of history during which [[Arthur Simonson|The Great Adventurer King]] liberated and commanded the holdings of [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] in a guerrilla-civil war against the [[Bandit Lords]] that had grasped the area.

Beginning in [[Prime Timeline#The Age of Beginning|056AF]] and lasting until [[Prime Timeline#The Age of Beginning|059AF]], the war was hard fought. Some key holdings were [[Yerba]] for its centrality, [[Gambleum]] for its rich resources, and [[Janesland]] for its large population.
