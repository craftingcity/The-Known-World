### Intro

In many stories told here, at this table, we begin with five special words. Today, we will not, for we are not returning to a story we have already told. Today, we begin a new story; one of adventure and passion. 

Interior, a Silver Unicorn in Coalition City. A great smash appears from outside, as glass shatters against the cobblestone streets; "STOP HIM".
