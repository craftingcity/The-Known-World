#### Early Life

Big Buster Badass was never a "bright" child. In many ways, people would underestimate them for it, only ever thinking that Buster was capable of brute applications of her strengths. As he grew up, they began to use this preconception against their opposition.

As they came to join [[Arthur Simonson]], they earned the title of "Big Badass", and tales of the "sick ass tricks" they would perform during combat would become legendary.
