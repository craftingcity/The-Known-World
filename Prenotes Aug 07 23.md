### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had taken to the streets in search of clues that would lead them toward agents of Orcus. After speaking with a few people you believed may have knowledge on the matter, you found yourselves in a Temple dedicated to Tauruin where a particular devotee caught your attentions.

After following him into the back of the temple and reasonably confirming your suspicions, you allowed him to lead you to a ceremony he was to attend. You intervened before things escalated, and have since detained the three survivors of the encounter.
