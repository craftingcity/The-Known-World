### Foreword

This text is written in response to the public release of "[[On the Hum Arcani; Guild Position]]", which was notably poorly received by many "independent" mages (ei; mages who do not work directly or tangentially with the [[Guild of Wizards]], including many Acolytes of the Emotional Gods and Members of the Druid Circles, many of whom have attached their name to the following document).

# On the Hum Arcani; Independent Position
## by [[Dimble Turring]], [[Scree'up]], [[Doctor Gunagido]] et al.

*In response to the Guild of Wizards*;

This was a political call to action. This was not any kind of real explanation, and is much more significant as a political move regarding the massive mistake that is the Council of Mages' response to "the Hum Arcani". The name itself is misleading and does not tell us anything about what actually has happened to our home, but I digress;

*In response to Nicolas Talaveem*;

Fuck you. Your soldiers, Adventurers, Rangers, rapscalions may they be, are dying in the streets. The two weeks you and the council spent twilddling your dick fingers in prayer to Sune's wisdom on your actions could have been spent preparing people and working together; which you have the audacity to request of the public in the same breath as you spew your political orgasm upon Alaturmen at large.

*In urgencies to the public*;

Stay safe. Gather together.

Pray to your gods for strength, and know falsehoods.

In honest truth, the least able and willing to prepare among us are the most vulnerable. I urge you to gather weapons and learn to use them. Protect the most vulnerable in your community, not just in physicality, but spirituality.

*What we think really happened*;

At the edge of the world, there is some barrier, some of you call it something else, but I call it the Wildlands. Those who cross it do not return. 

The Wildlands have "broken" before. The area now know as the Redl'nds is one of the largest examples of this, and the Lord's Folly is the second. Both of these places are very clear scars of what is beyond us. What is beyond what we know.

Or so we thought. 

For some, the return of [[Eladrithal Greystone]] of the [[Grey Ordeal]] was enough proof to squander their lives upon some imaginary profit or glory. [[The Return of Moses the Brave]] was proof enough that it is possible - and clearly extremely deadly. Whatever is beyond the Wildlands is going to kill you, in no uncertain terms. Eladrithal and Moses, to the best of accounting, have been directly quoted as describing themselves as "lucky to return"
