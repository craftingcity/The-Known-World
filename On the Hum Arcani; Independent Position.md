### Foreword

This text is written in response to the public release of "[[On the Hum Arcani; Guild Position]]", which was notably poorly received by many "independent" mages (ei; mages who do not work directly or tangentially with the [[Guild of Wizards]]).

# On the Hum Arcani; Independent Position
## by [[Dimble Turring]], [[Scree'up]], et al.

In response to the Guild of Wizards;

This was a political call to action. This was not any kind of real explanation, and is much more significant as a political move regarding the massive mistake that is the Council of Mages' response to "the Hum Arcani". The name itself is misleading and does not tell us anything about what actually has happened to our home, but I digress;

In response to Nicolas Talaveem;

Fuck you. Your soldiers, Adventurers, Rangers, rapscalions may they be, are dying in the streets. The two weeks you and the council spent twilddling your dick fingers in prayer to Sune's wisdom on your actions could have been spent preparing people and working together; which you have the audacity to request of the public in the same breath as you spew your political orgasm upon Alaturmen at large.

In urgencies to the public;

Stay safe. Pray to your gods for strength, and know falsehoods.
