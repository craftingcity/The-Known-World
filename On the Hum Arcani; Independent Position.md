### Foreword

This text is written in response to the public release of "[[On the Hum Arcani; Guild Position]]", which was notably poorly received by many "independent" mages (ei; mages who do not work directly or tangentially with the [[Guild of Wizards]], including many Acolytes of the Emotional Gods and Members of the Druid Circles, many of whom have attached their name to the following document).

# On the Hum Arcani; Independent Position
## by [[Dimble Turring]], [[Scree'up]], [[Doctor Gunagido]], et al.

*In response to the Guild of Wizards*;

This was a political call to action. This was not any kind of real explanation, and is much more significant as a political move regarding the massive mistake that is the Council of Mages' response to "the Hum Arcani". The name itself is misleading and does not tell us anything about what actually has happened to our home, but I digress;

*In response to Nicolas Talaveem*;

Fuck you. Your soldiers, Adventurers, Rangers, rapscalions may they be, are dying in the streets. The two weeks you and the council spent twilddling your dick fingers in prayer to Sune's wisdom on your actions could have been spent preparing people and working together; which you have the audacity to request of the public in the same breath as you spew your political orgasm upon Alaturmen at large.

His name is Orcus. He is real. He has other names, such as Hades, Dis Pater, and Jupiter. These names do hold power, but their invocation in speech and common discussion is not a danger to us. Their worship, invitation, and reverence (including actions such as *giving a name power*) is the real danger.

*In urgencies to the public*;

Stay safe. Gather together.

Pray to your gods for strength, and know falsehoods.

In honest truth, the least able and willing to prepare among us are the most vulnerable. I urge you to gather weapons and learn to use them. Protect the most vulnerable in your community, not just in physicality, but spirituality.

*Lets talk specifics - the Wildlands*;

At the edge of the world, there is some barrier, some of you call it something else, but I call it the Wildlands. Those who cross it do not return. 

The Wildlands have "broken" before. The area now know as the Redl'nds is one of the largest examples of this, and the Lord's Folly is the second. Both of these places are very clear scars of what is beyond us, as well as the *two* instances that the "barrier" has been breached. What is beyond this barrier is beyond what we know.

Or so we thought. 

For some, the return of [[Eladrithal Greystone]] of the [[Grey Ordeal]] was enough proof to squander their lives upon some imaginary profit or glory. [[The Return of Moses the Brave]] was proof enough that it is possible - and clearly extremely deadly. 

Whatever is beyond the Wildlands is going to kill you, in no uncertain terms. Eladrithal and Moses, to the best of accounting, have been directly quoted as describing themselves as "lucky to return" in their *public* testimonies. The truer horrors they have recounted to the void are unknowable.

What is clear, however, is that this barrier is permeable - it can be traversed, both by the spirit and body - and that it has a leak. Somewhere, the dam does not hold. The people we have lost to the "black-blood curse" were the first to feel this effect. 

*Lets talk specifics - the Blood*;

Samples of blood and viscera recovered by independent operators have been analyzed, and experimentation has revealed that in addition to its physical properties (such as it's acidity) it has a distinct residue in the Weave. This residue remains in the Weave and affects its manifestation, even after the offending substance has been removed from the area, and it in fact persists for a number of days.

This residue has affected the minds of vulnerable members of our population, leading them to either start or join organizations that purposefully continue to manipulate others into joining and reforming their ideals. In simple terms, *a cult*.

The "black-blood curse" was a horrible experience, and continues to rage across many areas of Alaturmen, but it was only the first wave. In addition to those most directly affected, secondary actors have been coerced into creating *cults* in the **worship, invitation, and reverence of Orcus**. 

*Lets talk specifics - the Future*;

Reports of new and outlandish dangers should be taken seriously. The so-called "horror-kin" should be identified. The heretical whispers of dead returning to life should be investigated. To the best of your ability, prepare yourself, and continue as normal. While I can not agree with all of the Guild's individual actions, the institution as a whole has been beneficial to the common folk, and should be trusted. Nicolas Talaveem should apologize for his blatantly false statements or resign from his position in the Council of Mages and the Guild of Wizards.

Be wary, and understand that the only constant in change.
