### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were in the city of [[Boneborn]], the great White Walled city in the [[Reugb Marshes]], holding a tournament. They have been dealing with a few different factions as of late; including a section of the Aquan Circle - the Green Spring Druids - and the [[Ammarin Transportation]] Company of the [[Westlick Mossland]].
