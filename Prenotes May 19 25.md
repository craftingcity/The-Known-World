### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had come together in the city of Mossburg. They had each received a letter, which as little context as it could while moving you to work together to "deliver a package" to the Garrison in the center of the city. The one of you who could have known chose to withhold the very relevant information regarding your package. This was less delivery service and more domestic terrorism.

In attempts at distraction, Emilio started a brawl with the standing guard outside as the more magically inclined quickly drew chaos to the street. Noticing the fight, some of the civilians rose to your aid against the Mossburg Enforcers, taking the fallen guards weapons and turning them towards your opponents - and then the bomb went off. The building was ruined. Anyone inside is dead, or grievously wounded, and the fate of those below, in the prisons, is unknown. We return to this moment, as the dust continues to flow, and your ears continue to ring. The fight that was occurring has paused, either for injury or awe, and it has presented you all a moment of choice. What do you want to do? 

### What does the World Know?

	- `Hey Em. Good, we'll have more for you in a bit. Payment comes in a few days, don't worry, they'll pump your account at GoM. We can hook you up with some classes, if that's what you mean, but otherwise I'll look for some things for you.`
- Leliana's Siblings
- Mossburg's Prisioners / Whats happened to the Enforcers
- **We need to get payed!** / They're giving us more work

### What happened?

"The Black Ghost"; murderer/cop killer (5ksp for capture)
	- Leliana asks about reward for recruiting to Company

We want more jobs from the Company, says Leliana.

We leave our heroes on the date of 7/19 106AF, as they wait for their payment to get transferred and for more jobs to come their ways.
