### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had removed themselves from the [[Temple of Many]] and the temporary detainment of the responding [[Noble House a'LeQuinn]] guards. After speaking with one [[Sir Harris Bly]], they received permission to investigate the occurrence that had brought them all together, and a potential opportunity for reward money.
