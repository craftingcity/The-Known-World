Hobgoblins are a #goblinoid race. This means a few things;
- They have a legitimate claim to being "here first", given that humans and elves and dwarves "came" here when [[Tetrimoc]] fell.
- They are born of planscape; giving and begetting thing one
- They are sibling to the other two #goblinoid races

# Who Are the Hobgoblins?
The Hobgoblins are a big brother to the [[Goblin Specifics|Goblin]], and little brother to the [[Bugbear Specifics|Bugbear]]. They used to share the world as  a family, but since the "men" came, the #goblinoid races have seen the lesser in eachother, and often look down upon their siblings; They work together often, however, and are a good team. The Hobgoblins are the smartest of the group, by a margin, and when isolated as a group or singularly, they are quite militaristic and imperial. Their [[Goblin Specifics|little siblings]] can often convince them to see the fun in living for something other than military honor, and they can convince their [[Bugbear Specifics|older siblings]] to think less often of here and now. As stated, they work together well as a team.
