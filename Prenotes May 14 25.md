### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had pursued the Illithid that was blasting rays of energy from its eye into the capital building of Deepreach. Finding the interior of the building wholly obliterated, they turned downwards, meeting their prey in a central chamber that - while having a civic purpose once - is now ruined with the stinking film of purple goop and the beating roots of the Illithid. You have cut down many of your enemies, but your battle is not yet won - although you may be tired and injured, you persist in the face of this present horror, and you fight.

Before we resume, can I get a status check? What health is everyone on, what resources do we have?

### What does the World Know?
==do NOT allow a retreat==

We're finishing this campaign in Deepreach, *tonight*.

#### They're feeling good!
The Psyflayer is the singular avatar of the Elder Brain, who lives in 'the Forge', one level below us. Our tendrils reach up and out, these three in the room right now are the ones that go straight up - therefore, we can drop the party a ways, and they're gonna end up on top of Elder Brain. This is not exactly 'tactically sound', but it is gonna be a fun narrative that can actually 'remove the threat' (as it exists at this time).

The dwarves of Deepreach have been collected here, amongst the rubble of what was once a monument of industry, in tight rows and columns. Standing there, until their bodies rot, to be absorbed into the biofilm the species subsists upon.

Sensing danger, and under the advice of the Psyflayer, the Masses awaken, and will constantly and unendingly approach the party's position at strengths of 2d4 Masses per round. The Elder Brain has 0 AC, and 120HP it shares with the Psyflayer. While the Elder Brain is attacked directly in this state (ie, while the Psyflayer is alive) it reflects half the damage it takes. After this, it has another 80HP before it dies, ceasing the Illithid operations under it's control, and it does not reflect any damage while in this state - although the Masses continue coming.

#### They're feeling hurt...
The Psyflayer is the final boss! As it is defeated, a psychic scream is released, and the veins in Deepreach slowly stop their pulsing beat. Although this may wreak havoc on the current party, this is the cost of victory. If anyone emerges, and survives the climb back to Forgehome, they will be safe - heralded as a hero of the area, and either returned to the surface, or hosted within the city, heartily compensated in either case. Otherwise, their deeds will be discovered years later, by adventurers yet unborn. Their tale unsung, but not unperformed. The Illithid of Deepreach, and therefore of those too in the areas around [[Forgehome]] and [[Mountain Hall]] are either destroyed, disabled, or released under the power of the psychic scream.

#### Post-Game

Lets figure our endings (if they didn't die), and figure what we want to play next (between the boys, who would feel most ready?)

### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
