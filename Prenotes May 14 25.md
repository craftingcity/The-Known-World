### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had pursued the Illithid that was blasting rays of energy from its eye into the capital building of Deepreach. Finding the interior of the building wholly obliterated, they turned downwards, meeting their prey in a central chamber that - while having a civic purpose once - is now ruined with the stinking film of purple goop and the beating roots of the Illithid. You have cut down many of your enemies, but your battle is not yet won - although you may be tired and injured, you persist in the face of this present horror, and you fight.

Before we resume, can I get a status check? What health is everyone on, what resources do we have?

### What does the World Know?
==do NOT allow a retreat==

The dwarves of Deepreach have been collected here, amongst the rubble of what was once a monument of industry, in tight rows and columns. Standing there, until their bodies rot, to be absorbed into the biofilm the species subsists upon.

#### They're feeling hurt...
The Psyflayer is the final boss! As it is defeated, a psychic scream is released, and the veins in Deepreach slowly stop their pulsing beat. Although this may wreak havoc on the current party, this is the cost of victory. If anyone emerges, and survives the climb back to Forgehome, they will be safe - heralded as a hero of the area, and either returned to the surface, or hosted within the city, heartily compensated in either case. Otherwise, their deeds will be discovered years later, by adventurers yet unborn. Their tale unsung, but not unperformed. The Illithid of Deepreach, and therefore of those too in the areas around [[Forgehome]] and [[Mountain Hall]] are either destroyed, disabled, or released under the power of the psychic sc
