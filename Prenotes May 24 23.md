### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had survived an attack by a patrol of vulture-esq creatures on their way into the one city they know of in this area. For one reason or another, the group has decided to split into two groups of 4 - yourselves, grouping together.



### What does the World Know?

A number of hours into travel, the party at large will see a vison of Grande, who performs a quick song for them;

> Giant gorilla eating ghost people, used spell to get through, go around or dont go. Wizards are corrupt, fuck this place, we are leaving, ttyl

### What happened?
