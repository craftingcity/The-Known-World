### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had received the second of three packages for [[Alergra Barrowinch]], the party negotiated travel with a water-merchant caravan headed to the [[Alvalini River]]. We now return to [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]], heat beating down from the yellow sun tall in the sky, where a covered caravan slowly begins to scroll along the sand - pulled by some creature underneath the sand.
