# Title
#### A sub-region of {Greater Region}
## Boundaries
*Mechanical Size:* Alexandrian Hexcrawl rules state that a "hex" is 12 miles across. We didn't build the map that way, so we cant really do that, but adjusting for that scale should be fine; look at how big the region is, find about how many 12 mile hexes would fit, and build "a hex" per 12-mile-hex-area.
