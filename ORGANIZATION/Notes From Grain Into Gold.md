We use the standard 100:10:1 for cp:sp:gp.

Adventurers are *not* the most important people in the world, although they do end up with a great deal of power and connection.

2,100sp is the annual wage of a basic laborer, bread costs 5cp per loaf, and requires labor from the farmer, miller, and baker.

Pork and Chicken are good family farm animals, Cattle are a luxury food, although they are good investments for farmers.

Nuts are a powerful (and popular, on Alaturmen) source of protein. Apples make good drink, Wine makes expensive drink. Spices make wars.

Consider Land, Overhead and Cutting Corners.

When folks don't work, they hunt and gather, although these are professions unto themselves.

Middlemen transport via caravans over land (at ~1.6sp/barrel/day) and ships over water (at ~1.6sp/barrel/day)...

**The example given at this point is much too large for Alaturmen as it is, folks use the Avalani to transport goods up and down the coast and to and from the city.**

... and gather to sell ***AT HAGGLE***, lemme repeat ***AT HAGGLE*** based on culture (asking price is maybe even 10x reasonable). Reasonable price determined by rarity in region and competitors.

Don't forget about taxes.

And risk.

Two ways for crafters to think about their money, as a wage or as a profit - wages are for professionals, profits are for giggers.

Medium risk is about +20% wages. Increasing exponetially, with adventurers earning thousands of silver for their death defying feats. If a merchant thinks they could negotiate a better price to hire these people for, they will. 

Servicers cannot stock inventory and need to make a certain amount, leading them to charge more for less work than a craftsmen, but if a price becomes established, they will have to compete for costumers more than pricing. 

Clothing is typically expensive, and especially because people want it dyed.

A pound of unrefined rock salt would cost about 2.5cp. It is common enough to be used as a universally acceptable currency.
