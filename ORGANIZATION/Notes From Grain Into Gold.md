We use the standard 100:10:1 for cp:sp:gp.

Adventurers are *not* the most important people in the world, although they do end up with a great deal of power and connection.

2,100sp is the annual wage of a basic laborer, bread costs 5cp per loaf, and requires labor from the farmer, miller, and baker.

Pork and Chicken are good family farm animals, Cattle are a luxury food, although they are good investments for farmers.

Nuts are a powerful (and popular, on Alaturmen) source of protein. Apples make good drink, Wine makes expensive drink. Spices make wars and better food.

Consider Land, Overhead and **Cutting Corners**.

When folks don't work, they hunt and gather, although these are professions unto themselves.

Middlemen transport via caravans over land (at ~1.4sp/barrel/day) and ships over water (at ~1.6sp/barrel/day)...

**The example given at this point is much too large for Alaturmen as it is, folks use the Avalani to transport goods up and down the coast and to and from the city.**

... and gather to sell ***AT HAGGLE***, lemme repeat ***AT HAGGLE*** based on culture (asking price is maybe even 10x reasonable). Reasonable price determined by rarity in region and competitors.

Don't forget about taxes.

And risk.

Two ways for Craftsmen to think about their money, as a wage or as a profit - wages are for professionals, profits are for giggers.

Medium risk is about +20% wages. Increasing exponentially, with adventurers earning thousands of silver for their death defying feats. If a merchant thinks they could negotiate a better price to hire these people for, they will. 

People who provide Services cannot stock inventory and need to make a certain amount, leading them to charge more for less work than a craftsmen, but if a price becomes established, they will have to compete for costumers more than pricing. 

Clothing is typically expensive, and especially because people want it dyed.

A pound of unrefined rock salt would cost about 2.5cp. It is common enough and desired to be used as a universally acceptable currency.

Preserving food reduces the amount of edible food, but the costs of preserving are higher than producing, so the end result is less food for more (or about the same amount) money - and it conforms to a container in both quantity and pricing. 

Pewter, Tin, Steel and Copper are valued roughly the same. Lead and Iron are also valued roughly the same, at 1/3 Copper. Bronze is valued at 2 times Copper. All prices change if not taken at source. Obviously, certain metals are more or less useful for certain things and more or less abundant, both factors will change the pricing. 

Remember 100cp:10sp:1gp.

Coins are a little freaky because minting costs something; If an ounce of silver is worth 1sp, a pound of silver is worth 16sp, and yet there are 25sp in a pound when sent and processed by the mint! This means that a silver coin is actually only 2/3 of an ounce of silver. A mint only is making 50% profit for cost because of the materials and labor. If coinage is too impure, it may become unacceptable internationally, and cause dismay or war.

Remember Food-Waste -> Animals -> Food

Remember Oils, Crop Rotation, and Region Weather / Temperature.

Hemp is useful, especially for ropes, but not to make oil or fine clothing. Flax makes linen, which is finer than canvas, but silk is the finest form these three. Velvet is best made with silk, but could be mimiced with other materials. Oven very rich folks don't wear true velvet often.

Lye makes soap and glass.

Wax makes seals, from bees, or bayberries, or fat.

Vinegar is made from any alcohol and will cost 10% more. 

The trapping trade is based on beaver trappers trapping 2.5 beavers per day and selling the pelts for 4.5sp.

Buttons are rare, zippers are rarer, broaches are common, lacing is also probably common enough.

A slave without any training would run 100sp and one with basic training would range closer to 250sp, while one that could perform a specialized task would cost about a third more every two sp a non-slave would make performing the job (say 350 for a 8sp task, 500 for a 12sp and so on), in any case, a slave needs to be provided with food and shelter, as well as supervision and enforcement. Just as there are other overly priced commodities, buyers beware when failing to authenticate or appraise.

Dining out costs 4x at lower end places and 6x at higher ones.

Don't forget, always be Cutting Corners.

Diamonds are super useful, pretty, and rare, meaning they're great to use as our "top" valuable, at 1000sp for a one carat diamond and doubling in value every 50% increase in size, a two carat diamond is 3500sp and a three carat diamond is 7,000sp, and so on.

Rubies, Sapphires, Emerald, and Amethyst are all in the same tier, but Amethyst are worth less bc of real life lore, which is why the darnt hillkeep exports a bunch of Amethyst.

Pearls are cool. Baroque (aka shitty not perfect ones) cost 20-25sp average. Round (aka cool perfect good ones) cost 500sp. Both will be more valuable when worked into a piece, like all other materials.

An arrow costs about 1sp because its time intensive.

A small backpack costs 10sp, but adventurers carry a lot of / heavy shit so they would need better and bigger packs.

Because Alaturmen is low magic high fantasy, magical effects need to be expensive, but available. Enchanting, Healing, and Alchemy are all important magical jobs. Other tasks can be performed and enhanced by magic, but this would pay more along the lines of a very rare specialist than one of the above.

Two things are true of all mortals. Death. Taxes.

Personal taxes seem like bogus, so Alaturmen focuses on Tariffs, Tolls, and Community Service, and Tithe.

This is the economy of a medivel feudalistic society; most people work from the wake to the sleep of their days. Summer gives the most people free time (specifically farmers). Relaxing work is considered recreation, equipment games can be expensive or cheap, people drink, smoke, and generally share these things, and when towns get large enough, people host performers and festivals and fairs. Fairs and Festivals are vital to the economy and mental health of the world, and this is important enough that high ups are willing to sponsor them. Sports too make good recreation, as well as good training; a sport will efficiently train if it conforms to the required skills of the military style of the region.

Most economy interaction is trade, even when prices are listed. Pelts, Salt, and other staple goods would be more acceptable than coinage for most people, meaning that a hunter/gatherer may mark up their prices 4x in coins compared to Pemmican.
