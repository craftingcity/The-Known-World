We use the standard 100:10:1 for cp:sp:gp.

Adventurers are *not* the most important people in the world, although they do end up with a great deal of power and connection.

2,100sp is the annual wage of a basic laborer, bread costs 5cp per loaf, and requires labor from the farmer, miller, and baker.

Pork and Chicken are good family farm animals, Cattle are a luxury food, although they are good investments for farmers.

Nuts are a powerful (and popular, on Alaturmen) source of protein. Apples make good drink, Wine makes expensive drink. Spices make wars and better food.

Consider Land, Overhead and **Cutting Corners**.

When folks don't work, they hunt and gather, although these are professions unto themselves.

Middlemen transport via caravans over land (at ~1.4sp/barrel/day) and ships over water (at ~1.6sp/barrel/day)...

**The example given at this point is much too large for Alaturmen as it is, folks use the Avalani to transport goods up and down the coast and to and from the city.**

... and gather to sell ***AT HAGGLE***, lemme repeat ***AT HAGGLE*** based on culture (asking price is maybe even 10x reasonable). Reasonable price determined by rarity in region and competitors.

Don't forget about taxes.

And risk.

Two ways for Craftsmen to think about their money, as a wage or as a profit - wages are for professionals, profits are for giggers.

Medium risk is about +20% wages. Increasing exponentially, with adventurers earning thousands of silver for their death defying feats. If a merchant thinks they could negotiate a better price to hire these people for, they will. 

People who provide Services cannot stock inventory and need to make a certain amount, leading them to charge more for less work than a craftsmen, but if a price becomes established, they will have to compete for costumers more than pricing. 

Clothing is typically expensive, and especially because people want it dyed.

A pound of unrefined rock salt would cost about 2.5cp. It is common enough and desired to be used as a universally acceptable currency.

Preserving food reduces the amount of edible food, but the costs of preserving are higher than producing, so the end result is less food for more (or about the same amount) money - and it conforms to a container in both quantity and pricing. 

Pewter, Tin, Steel and Copper are valued roughly the same. Lead and Iron are also valued roughly the same, at 1/3 Copper. Bronze is valued at 2 times Copper. All prices change if not taken at source. Obviously, certain metals are more or less useful for certain things and more or less abundant, both factors will change the pricing. 

Coins are a little freaky because minting costs something; If an ounce of silver is worth 1sp, a pound of silver is worth 16sp, and yet there are 25sp in a pound when sent and processed by the mint! This means that a silver coin is actually only 2/3 of an ounce of silver. A mint only is making 50% profit for cost because of the materials and labor. If coinage is too impure, it may become unacceptable internationally, and cause dismay or war.

Remember Food-Waste -> Animals -> Food

Remember Oils, Crop Rotation, and Region Weather / Temperature.

Hemp is useful, especially for ropes, but not to make oil or fine clothing. Flax makes linen, which is finer than canvas, but silk is the finest form these three. Velvet is best made with silk, but could be mimiced with other materials. Oven very rich folks don't wear true velvet often.
