# Mystical Military
In a setting that includes arcanology, theology, and mysticism as valid and efficient paths towards influence and power, our reflection of this fact in warfare is important to the diegesis our consumers experience. In the world of Alaturmen, magic is understood, but it is exponentially expensive. 

In an attempt at reasonable consistency, the following is assumed about Alaturmen's Magical Armies;
	- Given a population, a leader can raise 5-15% of them as levees.
	- Given a population, a leader has employed 0.5-3% of them as soldiers.
	- A leader will prepare their soldiers significantly more than their levees.
	- A leader can only consistently supply spells and magical effects of 2nd level or lower.
	- Characters of greater ability are considered "heroes", and cannot reasonably be included in a generic accounting of warfare.
