# Mystical Military
In a setting that includes arcanology, theology, and mysticism as valid and efficient paths towards influence and power, our reflection of this fact in warfare is important to the diegesis our consumers experience. In the world of Alaturmen, magic is understood, but it is exponentially expensive. 

In an attempt at reasonable consistency, the following is assumed about Alaturmen's Magical Armies;
	- Given a population, a leader can raise 5-15% of them as levees.
	- Given a population, a leader has employed 0.5-3% of them as soldiers.
	- A leader will prepare their soldiers significantly more than their levees.
	- A leader can only consistently supply spells and magical effects of 2nd level or lower.
	- Characters of greater ability are considered "heroes", and cannot reasonably be included in a generic accounting of warfare.

### Organization & Logistics
The traditional aspects of Organization & Logistics apply to a mystical military. Keeping your army fed and equipped for battle is necessary, and as such, so too is a significant logistics network. The majority of magical effects within the given restrictions provide insignificant change from a conventional organizational structure or that structure's logistics operations.

- *Message*; Given the range restriction on the generic invocation of this spell, Message is primarily used for internal squad communications.
- *Force Disk*, *Mage Hand*, *Unseen Servant*; Engineering & Logistics squads use a variety of minor magical effects to move larger volumes of equipment or materials as quickly as they could smaller volumes.
- *Local Sending*, *Skywrite*; Used by Field Commanders and Generals alike, the combination of a (non-extradimensional) Sending network for instant, long-range communications and Skywrite for mass information dissemination allows for consistent upkeep of important operational information.
- *Spare the Dying*, *Cure Wounds*, *Healing Spirit*, *Lesser Restoration*; Used by Medical personnel, magical healing - even within the consistency restrictions - allow for a dramatic decrease in the loss of 'true manpower' in a given army. While this can elongate the length of an individual battle, it's effect is most noticeable on the grand-strategy stage.

These simple effects allow for a mystical army to act in similarity to an army in our modern world - consistent communication, power-tooled logistics units, and life-saving medicines (or spells).
