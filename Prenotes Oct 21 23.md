### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they met with agents of many factions. First, with their so-believed patrons, the Council of Mages, receiving rewards for your hard work done and receiving a new potential direction to pursue; [[The Old|Minyostalma's Ruins]]. Second, with a pursuer representing the interests of [[Cenva Minyo]] who explained that he was to gather information on you, your activities, and what you think you know. 

You are in the center of the world, and you are brimming with potential. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

It is currently the evening of the second of Weeding, of the 105th year.

I think they had a meeting set up with Paulo Equestria (the Cenva Minyo contact they captured and released) on the 3rd, but he doesn't know anything they don't except perhaps general history and/or the organization's involvement in supporting [[The Grey Ordeal]] during the [[First Invasion of Orcus]].

The Wizards have not heard from [[Qiell Tilemundon]] since he dipped with [[Kalariel]]. They are not yet concerned, but when the week passes and he does not appear for the weekly meeting, the council may be forced to act.

[[The Old|Minyostalma]] is fairly static so far, and it is a series of ruins surrounding the Grand Temple building.

### What happened?

Might run into Moses at the S
