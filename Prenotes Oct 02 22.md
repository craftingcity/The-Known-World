### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they found themselves on the winning end of a tense fight with a group of Goblin associated with the [[Scrivin Clan]]. The air around you is warm and thick, as embers and flames lick through the air.

### What does the World Know?

#### TRUTHS

2. Villanella left in a hurry.
3. Villanella's bounty may be less than reputable.
