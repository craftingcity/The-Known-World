### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they found themselves on the winning end of a tense fight with a group of Goblin associated with the [[Scrivin Clan]]. The air around you is warm and thick, as embers and flames lick through the air.

Just in front of you and the bodies of the goblins you have just killed, a large wooden building is blazing, it's thatch roof folding in upon itself as it's supports begin to fail.

You are here for information on a bounty; Villanella, alive, for 9000 silver. You have her address, she lives in a northeastern suburb of Aeberu, you are in the westernmost outskirts of town. With you, convinced by lust and alcohol,

### What does the World Know?

I don't really know who Villanella is yet, but I'm fairly certain she works for a branch of the [[Cenva Minyo]] as an Accountant. She lived in a large single story home, furnished for up to two, but used only by one. 

#### TRUTHS
1. Villanella works for [[Cenva Minyo]] as an accountant.
	- ledgers in locked drawer of desk name [[Cenva Minyo]] as a repeat customer of "Consumer Goods" from the Aeberu Institution of Export.
	- note in clothing reads "Molca~marale~malo, maita~massa~ ~mandya onnamma. Cenva Minyo. / *YOUR WORK IS APPRECIATED COMRADE, BREAD AND BUTTER FEEDS OUR CHILDREN. FOR THE HATRED OF FLAME. WE LIVE HERE.* "
	- 
2. Villanella left in a hurry.
	- a bag of clothing lies strewn across the bed
	- a candle is burnt out at the endtable of the bed
	- no doors or windows into the house are locked
3. Villanella's bounty is more than a simple catch and cash.
	- painted across her door; "COME SWIM ELF"
	- a letter reads; "Dearest Villanella, It has come to the attention of the Guild of Merchants, in particular my desk, that there are discrepancies in the accounting figures you have submitted with regard to your expenses, revenues and the calculated profits and in particular the *taxes* you owe as the *single* owner of the Aeberu Institution of Export. The dogs smell the burn of paper. Go home. We will not lose ground. You will find reassignment after this fire dies. *Alalintie* comrade. - K.R.S."
