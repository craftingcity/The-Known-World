The Guilds of Coalition in Alaturmen are considered by most of the "civilized" people of Alaturmen to be the greater governance - something that collects your leader and your ally's leader and your enemy's leader.

The Guilds are collected together at the twice annual Communicae, alongside representatives of the greater national states of Coalition.
