# Nicolas Talaveem

> A man of worn face and dark eyes. Perhaps his body is some 70 years, but his [[Marked By the Fire|soul bears a dark ancient mark]].

A first-generation human. Nicolas was orphaned by the [[50 Year Fires]]. He was adopted by [[Baron Yassir Cassindil|a family of elves]] that collected orphaned survivors of their [[The Old|psuedo-ancestral home]].

## History
As a child, Nicolas witnessed a horrible holy act, the [[50 Year Fires]]. He was [[Marked By the Fire]]. His adoptive family, the [[Baron Yassir Cassindil|Cassindils]], took him to their lands in the [[Grumbling Hills]] where he grew up in a small hamlet near [[Aeberu]].

Under the sponsorship and watch of the Cassindil family, Nicolas began to learn the sport of wand-weaving and quickly became a formidable opponent. 

As Nicolas began to reach adulthood, he was at the top of the wand-weaving game. He felt that no opponent could match him. He used his connections to the Cassindil family to begin to collect a personal collection of arcane texts of various sources.



## Location
Nicolas has a home in the hamlet near [[Aeberu]]
