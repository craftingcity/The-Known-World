### Intro


### What does the World Know?

We left a few minutes after the beginning of the raid on Yerba by (ostensibly) the Scrivin Clan;
	- Goblin, Orc, and Hobgoblin together ride Wargs into the market square.
	- Many others follow behind them, on foot.
	- The party entered the square from the opposite side of the square.
	- The sqaure has a fountain in the center.
	- [[Yerba#Notable Locations|Alvalini's Glasshouse]] is in the middle of the two forces.
