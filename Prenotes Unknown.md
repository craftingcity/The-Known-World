### Intro


### What does the World Know?

We left a few minutes after the beginning of the raid on Yerba by (ostensibly) the Scrivin Clan;
	- Goblin, Orc, and Hobgoblin together ride Wargs into the market square.
	- Many others follow behind them, on foot.
	- The party entered the square from the opposite side of the square.
	- The sqaure has a fountain in the center.
	- [[Yerba#Notable Locations|Alvalini's Glasshouse]] is in the middle of the two forces.

It's likely that the party will attempt to continue their work for [[Alergra Barrowinch]], and travel to the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] & further to [[The Golden City]] to do so, if they are able to do so.

### Darnt Hillkeep

[[Baron Jammu]] is awaiting the arrival of the misfits, and will collect a day of rest from them if they stay the night in her territory.

### The Golden City

[[Doctor Gunagido]] is currently deep within the City, in a [[Golden Claws]]' laboratory. He has left his personal laboratory in statis-quo 

### De-railed
We have encounters prepped, and tables & hexes for otherwise.
