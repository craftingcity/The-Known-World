### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had achieved a feat of great historical note; they performed a heist dozens of years in the making for a planar gate. While they gained a large swath of other items of personal importance, this so-called "Worldbinding" was the quarry of their current patron.

We return to them now; with the trample of hooves being accompanied by an off-key tune, the party travels north-east, snacking on Wurm jerky upon their path.

### What does the World Know?
