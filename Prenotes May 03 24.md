### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had fought bravely against a platoon of White Flame militants scavenging inside the Factory while the party and their allies were moving towards the Base, the last known location of Ghost's PDA.

We return to the party just moments after the Military called for a strategic retreat, as your Mercenary allies move forward to take and clear the space the Military occupied moments ago.

"Clear! Blue Team, you're pulling security, everyone else; Loot and Scoot, two minutes!"

As you all begin to move to the corpses, a dark brown metallic hand reaches out from inside Gringold's bag and pulls itself up, leading a tall muscular metal man to quickly jump to the floor with a loud clanging sound.

### What does the World Know?
###### Saving Private Colins
Pvt. Colins has been captured by the Chicago Bulls, and is not particularly knowledgeable about the truest ongoings of Minyostalma, but will do his best to exchange information for his life.

###### Militants Loot
The Mercs will each loot a corpse, leaving five down and dead for the party to scavenge. The Mercs will not share their claim, but they will leave some items behind.
