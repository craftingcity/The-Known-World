When last we left our heroes, they had traveled to the village of [[Kamarios]] under the impression that they could meet with the Black Mage in his tower there. Upon their entrance, there was no response, and as they continued, they were treated as intruders and attacked by the thick iron golem warriors. During the combat, the party was separated, with the new party members seemingly stuck inside the White Tower. 

Those on the outside attempted to learn more about the tower and the surrounding village, noting a lack of formal guardians for the people here and a seemingly nonchalant disposition to the very dangerous structure in their neighborhood. Before they could gather concrete information, their companions returned, having explored the inside of the tower to a similar effect. 

The tower was occupied, stocked with supplies, and defended - but it was seemingly empty. The people are not interested or scared or excited.
