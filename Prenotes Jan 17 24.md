### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had traveled to the village of [[Kamarios]] under the impression that they could meet with the Black Mage in his tower there. Upon their entrance, there was no response, and as they continued, they were treated as intruders and attacked by the thick iron golem warriors. During the combat, the party was separated, with the new party members seemingly stuck inside the White Tower. 

Those on the outside attempted to learn more about the tower and the surrounding village, noting a lack of formal guardians for the people here and a seemingly nonchalant disposition to the very dangerous structure in their neighborhood. Before they could gather concrete information, their companions returned, having explored the inside of the tower to a similar effect. 

The tower was occupied, stocked with supplies, and defended - but it was seemingly empty. The people are not interested or scared or excited. There was clearly more to the tower - those of you who went inside recall only ascending one flight of stairs the others did not - but you found no obvious manner of continuation.

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

Likely, they will try to reach [[Agrandica]] in her Savanna in [[Ahaustin]]. This trip, in a straight shot, will be 60 miles (aka 10 hexes, aka 2 days, aka 4 watches of Travel). Ash and Agrandica do not have a personal working relationship, and they have only been given her interpreted orders, when or if any (Ash more likely worked with a local boss under Agrandica).

Depending on what they request and present, Agrandica would be willing to offer a number of soldiers and supplies, but nothing that the Chicago Bulls would really look for - thats back in the White Tower, methinks - except for her magic gems...

If necessary, we'll task 2 groups and this group to capture a neutral Durandurm convoy headed from Kickoff to the Golden City. They will face resistance from both the Claws transporting it and another group of Theives (either is fine, Ba).
