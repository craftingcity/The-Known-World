### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they were on a grand journey across Alaturmen to gather and deliver three important packages for one [[Alergra Barrowinch]] - Archmage of [[Magius]] and Red Mage on the [[Guild of Wizards#Council of Mages]] - but they have since found intrigue of their own. 

[[Qiell Tilemundon]], Black Mage upon that same Council of Mages, recently paid the party a mysterious visit where he exchanged a small amount of information (see Dreams, [[Tubric Millstone Wrinsmith]]) before agreeing with the group's confusion regarding their connection and then departing.

Mysterious dreams, magical hums, and interactions with wizards have led the party to where they are now - on the main thoroughfare of the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] headed towards the opulent stone palace that rests at its head in attempts to speak with one [[Baron Jammu|Amethyst Jammu]], Baron Queen of [[Darnt Hillkeep]] and the Grumbling Hills - who supposedly has a package to be delivered.

### What does the World Know?

An agent of the palace - Lokhagos Imperial Borrich Graidy, first of their name, kinder of Alar, Hork, and Galix Graidy - will interrupt the party on their walk forward, rather quickly.

They want to know what business these outsiders have heading deeper into the city

### What happened?
