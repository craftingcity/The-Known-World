### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they were deep within the Hell of a mountain known as [[Kailkeep]]. In their exploration and in determination to escape, they allied with three young and weak adventurers, Benjamin, Yissa, and Aramond. 

These three proved their weakness with their retreat - unwilling to risk his sister's life in combating the horrible Rammik and his well-equipped Gang, Benjamin led his group to safety. It has been made clear that he will not be abandoning you in harms way again.

Proving little hazard to the more experienced heroes of our story, we return to the party as they complete their rest, post-combat, with their comrades in a beach-river chamber.

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
See [[Kailkeep]]. They are on Layer 4 still, and have yet to face the exit game or to play as the Home team in their Entrance games. Today's ingame date is 00:00 on the 18th.
