### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had gathered information from a captive by the name of Havar about a potential future meeting between a number of Infernal actors in the city of [[Boneborn]] on the 8th of Weeding.

They have chartered passage with Captain [[Revari Madrid]] of [[Northstone Family Trading Company]]'s 'The Embargo', and with the previous relationship plus the power of Breenabell's words, their trip cost them a measly sum in silver - though the cost in time had no discount.

We return to them now, an hour before the setting of nightfall, you exit your rooms at the Silver Unicorn and check out, setting off towards the docs of the [[Steel Ward]].

Is there anything you would like to do in town before you set off?
