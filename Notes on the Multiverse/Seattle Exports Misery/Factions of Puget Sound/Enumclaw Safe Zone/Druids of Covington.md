# Druids of Covington
The "Druids" of Covington are a post-bombing faction of survivors that have taken to survivalism in the forests surrounding Covington and the Enumclaw Safe Zone. In the time since the bombings, they have become seen as harbingers of peace and prosperity for the lost souls of the Sound.

The Druids are largely protected by their position as a 'faction of civilians', willing to submit to a greater authority for their own desire for normalcy. At the moment, they have good relationships with the members of the [[Kent Rangers Corps]], the [[Enumclaw Civilized Safe Zone]], and the [[Shadow Bandits]], providing honest fealty to all three factions.
