# Enumclaw Civilized Safe Zone
## History
Enumclaw was one of the few cities in Washington that was left largely untouched by the Bombing. A number of citizens survived, and have reclaimed Enumclaw as the Civilized Safe Zone. 

## Governance
The *ECSZ* is supposedly controlled by one man - [[The Man Upstairs]] - although no one really knows who that person is. Nevertheless, Enumclaw has strong alliances with the [[Druids of Covington]], the [[Muckleshoot Gamblers]], and the [[Shadow Bandits]], who all benefit from the *ECSZ* and participate in it's maintenance.

While not quite allied, the Safe Zone is relatively friendly to the members of the [[Kent Rangers Corps]], who will sometimes come to them for trade or recreation.
