Washington State had a population of roughly 7 million before the Bombings. The UN has estimated that less than five-hundred thousand individuals survived the immediate bombings in Washington State, and those among them who have continued to live beyond the immediate fallout have factionalized by location and association.

#### Areas of Interest
The following areas are occupied by their indicated factions - but some members of each faction could be found throughout the Puget Sound.
	- *North Seattle* (Shoreline, Edmonds, Mill Creek, and Cottage Lake)
			- The *North Seattle* area is notably abandoned. Some local individuals stayed safe in the wake of the bombings, but the majority of the population succumbed to immediate radiation poisoning. The area experiences significant conflict between the Shadow Bandits and the Tourist Paramilitary, which has led to the path north to be deemed dangerous - even when protected by members of one of the two factions.
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]] (see [[Peacemaker]])
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
	- *Ruins of Seattle* (White Center, Seattle Proper, Bellevue, Issaquah)
			- The *City of Seattle* has been nearly completely pulverized and destroyed. The area is highly irradiated, leading what little value survived to be ripe for the scavenging. 
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
		- [[Wasters of White Center]] (see [[Rat King]])
		- [[Sainthood Order of Seattle]]
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]]
	- *South Seattle* (Burien, Des Moines, Tukwila, Kent, Renton)
			- *South Seattle* is the second calmest and yet most fractured area of the Puget Sound. The northern region has been heavily damaged, but much of the rest of the region has been relatively spared from both the immediate pulverization and the following firestorms.
		- [[Sainthood Order of Seattle]] (see [[Father Patrick]])
		- [[Overwatch Airport Security]]
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
		- [[Normandy Guerilla Army]]
		- [[Kent Rangers Corps]]
