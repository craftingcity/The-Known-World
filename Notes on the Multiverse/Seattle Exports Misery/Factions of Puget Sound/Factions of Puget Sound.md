Washington State had a population of roughly 7 million before the Bombings. The UN has estimated that less than five-hundred thousand individuals survived the immediate bombings in Washington State, and those among them who have continued to live beyond the immediate fallout have factionalized by location and association.

#### Areas of Interest
The following areas are occupied by their indicated factions - but some members of each faction could be found throughout the Puget Sound.
	- *North Seattle* (Shoreline, Edmonds, Mill Creek, and Cottage Lake)
			- The *North Seattle* area is notably abandoned, no one is here who would call themselves 'local' anymore.
			- The area experiences significant conflict between the Shadow Bandits and the Tourist Paramilitary, which has increased the intensity of danger here - even while protected by members of one of the two factions.
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]] (see [[Peacekeeper]])
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
	- *Ruins of Seattle* (White Center, Seattle Proper, Bellevue, Issaquah)
			- The *City of Seattle* has been nearly completely destroyed by [[The Bombings]]. The area is highly irradiated and largely unpopulated.
			- Much of the surviving population has relocated underground.
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
		- [[Wasters of White Center]] (see [[Rat King]])
		- [[Sainthood Order of Seattle]]
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]]
	- *South Seattle* (Burien, Des Moines, Tukwila, Kent, Renton)
