Washington State had a population of roughly 7 million before the Bombings. The UN has estimated that less than five-hundred thousand individuals survived the immediate bombings in Washington State, and those among them who have continued to live beyond the immediate fallout have factionalized by location and association.

#### Areas of Interest
The following areas are occupied by their indicated factions - but some members of each faction could be found throughout the Puget Sound.
	- *North Seattle* (Shoreline, Edmonds, Mill Creek, and Cottage Lake)
			- The *North Seattle* area is notably abandoned. Some local individuals stayed safe in the wake of the bombings, but the majority of the population succumbed to immediate radiation poisoning. The area experiences significant conflict between the Shadow Bandits and the Tourist Paramilitary, which has led to the path north to be deemed dangerous - even when protected by members of one of the two factions.
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]] (see [[Peacemaker]])
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
	- *Ruins of Seattle* (White Center, Seattle Proper, Bellevue, Issaquah)
			- The *City of Seattle* has been nearly completely pulverized and destroyed. The area is highly irradiated and largely unpopulated, leading what little of value survived to become ripe for the scavenging. 
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
		- [[Wasters of White Center]] (see [[Rat King]])
		- [[Sainthood Order of Seattle]]
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]]
	- *South Seattle* (Burien, Des Moines, Tukwila, Kent, Renton)
			- *South Seattle* is the second calmest and yet most fractured area of the Puget Sound. The northern region has been heavily damaged, but much of the rest of the region has been relatively spared from both the immediate pulverization and the following firestorms.
		- [[Sainthood Order of Seattle]] (see [[Father Patrick]])
		- [[Overwatch Airport Security]]
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
		- [[Normandy Guerilla Army]]
		- [[Kent Rangers Corps]]
	- *Enumclaw Civilized Safe Zone* (Enumclaw)
			- The *ECSZ* is the calmest area of the Puget Sound, where the Enumclaw Civil Patrol keeps peace and trade in the area.
		- [[Enumclaw Civilized Safe Zone]] (see [[The Man Upstairs]])
		- [[Shadow Bandits]]
		- [[Kent Rangers Corps]]
		- [[Druids of Covington]]
		- [[Muckleshoot Gamblers]]
	- *Ruins of Tacoma* (Federal Way, Tacoma, Puyallup)
			- *Tacoma* was one of the direct targets of the nuclear warheads, and has been largely destroyed.
		- [[Kent Rangers Corps]] (see [[General Whittman]])
		- [[Fedway Scavs]]
		- [[Aria Edges]]
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]]
	- *South Tacoma* (Spanaway, JBLM)
			- *South Tacoma* was severely damaged by the blast in North Tacoma, but a large portion of the population here survived, including remnants of the Washington State Guard in the Joint-Base Louis-McCord
		- [[Fedway Scavs]] (see [[Savage]])
		- [[Aria Edges]]
		- [[Washington State Remnants]]
	- *Battlefield Olympia* (Tumwater, Olympia, Lacey)
			- Although the capital of the state, the city of *Olympia* remained untargeted, but not unaffected, by the nuclear warheads, and was the first area reclaimed by the Washington State Guard.
		- [[Aria Edges]]
		- [[Washington State Remnants]] (see [[General Hienz]])
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]]
	- *Western Sound* (Bangor Base, Gig Harbor)
			- Severely crippled by the targeting of the Bangor Base, the *Western Sound* area has turned incredibly violent.
		- [[Shadow Bandits]] (see [[Bradon Mills]])
		- [[Community of Vashon]] 
		- [[Washington State Remnants]] 
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]]
	- *Shock Islands* (Whidbery, Bainbridge, Vashon)
			- Insulated from the rest of the State, the *Shock Islands*, as they have come to be known, are incredibly isolationist - fearful of the infection spreading upon the islands.
		- [[Community of Vashon]] (see [[Tyler Otis]])
		- [[Washington State Remnants]]
		- [[Tourist Paramilitary]]
