# Sainthood Order of Seattle
## History
The Sainthood Order of Seattle is a collection of survivor groups related by their devotion to faith, despite their denomination.

## Governance
The Sainthood is a loose collective, and does not answer to a central *mortal* authority figure, but members of a given sect will likely submit to the local authority of a practiced theologist and leader, such as a priest.

## Culture
#### Heritage
A large plurality of the Sainthood Order is Latino/Hispanic.
#### Language
Primarily, communication is performed in American English, but a large plurality of the Sainthood Order is also fluent in American Spanish.
#### Values
The Sainthood values honestly, faith, and dedication to community above all else.
#### Theology
The Sainthood primarily practices Catholic and Protestant Christianity, but it vehemently accepts other practices as well.
#### Economics
While the Sainthood has no particular resource in abundance, it's openness toward the other factions of the Sound grants its members access into territory claimed by those other factions.

### Symbolism
##### S.O.S. Come To
"S.O.S. Come to God"
"S.O.S. Come to Faith"
"S.O.S. Faith in YOU"
"S.O.S. Safety in Faith"
"S.O.S. Safety in Divinity"
##### Space Needle Cross
A stencil spray of the Seattle Space Needle in black, onto which a white cross has been sprayed. An SOS Come To is often written below or above the Needle Cross.

## Technology
### Food & Water
The majority of Food is scavenged from unoccupied territories. Some Sects of the Sainthood have access to the space required for farming, or fishing, and will attempt to provide these foodstuffs to the greater Order.

Water is typically collected via "tarp-farm", and purified by boiling.

### Shelter
The Sainthood primarily attempts to shelter in Churches or Apartment Complexes and retrofit these spaces towards communal living.

### Arms & Armor
The Sainthood is generally under-equipped for survival in the Sound, having access to makeshift or home-made arms & armor.

The most equipped Sainthood Soldier would likely have some kind of plastic plate-mail, a lawn-blade machete, and maybe a simple firearm.
