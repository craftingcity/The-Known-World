## History
**1941** - **1945**; Nearly 12,000 Washington National Guard members were inducted into Federal Service at the beginning of World War II.

**1980**; More than 2,000 members of the Washington National Guard are called to state active duty when Mount St. Helens erupted.

**1997**; Washington National Guard members deployed to Bosnia in Federal Active service as part of Operation Joint Guardian.

**2000**; Washington National Guard members deployed to Macedonia in Federal Active service as part of Operation Joint Guardian.

**2003**; Since September 11, 2001 more than 13,000 citizen soldiers and airmen have served in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom *(Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia*), Operation Enduring Freedom/Freedom’s Sentinel (*Afghanistan, Philippines, Cuba, Djibouti (Horn of Africa), Korea, Uzbekistan*), and Operation Inherent Resolve (*Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Syria*). Nearly 900 Washington Guardsmen have served in support domestic operations of Noble Eagle within the United States to include Airport Security, Border Patrol, security at military bases, and miscellaneous missions in Bosnia, Germany, Egypt and Kuwait.

**2011**; Based off of recommendations in the Department of Defense’s Quadrennial Defense Review, the National Guard Bureau established the first two, of later ten, Homeland Response Forces (HRF) in Washington and Ohio. These HRFs are 560-person Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, high-yield Explosive (CBRNE) task forces established to support local, state and federal emergency managers in response to CBRNE disasters, or deliberate acts, and additional HAZMAT-related hazards.

**2013**; Based on recommendations given by the Department of Defense, the Washington National Guard deploys around the state of Washington. 

**2014**; A panic sets in. The Washington National Guard enforces martial law and curfew under orders of the State Governor, ###JOHN ADAMS###.

**2015**; Washington, alongside its 47 continental sisters, experiences an array of nuclear attacks that leave the majority of the region's infrastructure reduced to scrap, and destroying the political power the Governor held. The Washington National Guard does not last as a single entity, and allegiance to the concept begins to fail to hold true meaning.
