# Tourist Paramilitary
## History
Since the beginning of 2016, a number of militants have begun to appear in small pockets throughout the nation. Supported by the United Nations and their local national government, the so-called 'Tourist Paramilitary' is a decentralized collection of individualized squads, groups, or clans who are all relatively friendly towards eachother.



## Governance
The Paramilitary is composed of a large array of soldiers, but a number of nations provide more focus and support than others - predominantly China, Japan, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. 

These nations have sectioned portions of their official militaries into off-record recruitment and training operations. In an attempt to support unity between nations, these paramilitary soldiers will often transfer between military trainings and operations.
