# Wasters of White Center
## History
Since Seattle was bombed, radiation has ruined the city and it's inhabitants. White Center was not quite close enough to the center of the blast to be *totally* ruined. It's inhabitants have quickly attempted to adapt to their newest environment, turning their surroundings into their strengths.

## Governance
The Wasters have no formal government, but rather a more animalistic social order based on power or ability. The weak and stupid are useful only as a tool of the stronger.
