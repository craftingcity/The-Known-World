# Shadow Corporation / Shadow Bandits
## History
The Shadow Bandits were a gang (or group, if you prefer) formed after the Infections in 2012 of high ranking business folk, illicit or otherwise. Since the years before and after the Bombings, the Shadow Bandits have expanded their ranks and influence to a large region of the state - they specialize in shipping, preferably leaving manufacturing to other post-infection factions.

## Governance
Formed as a business response to the Infection of 2012, the Shadow Bandits have been governed by a 'board of directors' consisting of 9 'company' representatives.
