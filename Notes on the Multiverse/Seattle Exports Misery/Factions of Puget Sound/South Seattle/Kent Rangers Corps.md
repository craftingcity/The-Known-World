# Kent Rangers Corps
## History
The Kent Rangers were formed in the aftermath of the 2015 Bombings in response to the 'retreat to Olympia' order. Since the bombs, a number of surviving elements of Federal and State military forces who have made their trek into Washington have decided that their alliance lies not with the Washington State Remnants, but with [[General Whittman]], and the newly formed Kent Rangers Corps.
