# Kent Rangers Corps
## History
The Kent Rangers were formed in the aftermath of the 2016 Bombings; elements and members of Federal and State military forces within and around Washington retreated north-west as their command structures faltered and eventually completely failed. A number of those who have made their trek into Washington have decided that their alliance lies not with the Washington State Remnants, but with the newly formed Kent Rangers Corps.
