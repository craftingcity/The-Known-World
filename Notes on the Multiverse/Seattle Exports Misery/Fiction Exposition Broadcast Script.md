*In response to the violence within Kentucky, a survivor speaks...*

> As I look around my ravaged hometown in Kentucky, it feels as if we are living through a waking nightmare—a reality that none of us were prepared for. The decimated streets, the echoes of anguish, and the haunting screams of neighbors turned monsters fill the air, painting a grim portrait of an America that has been cast aside. We stood together in the wake of the chemical bomb, braving the initial horrors, believing our government would rise to the occasion, contain the disaster, and protect us. But as the infection spread and borders closed, that hope eroded faster than the very buildings around us.
> In these dark times, our leaders seem absent and our allies have turned their backs. Once a bounty to our nation, our state is now quarantined as if we are nothing but a festering wound. The deluge of misinformation and fear-mongering from those in power has stripped us of our voices, turning us into an afterthought on a global stage that no longer wants to acknowledge our suffering. Our cries are met with silence, our pleas for aid disregarded as if we are already doomed to become mere footnotes in a history written by others.
> As weeks turned into months, I have watched loved ones succumb to the infection, their humanity swallowed whole by a monstrous hunger. I have seen neighbors previously filled with warmth transformed into mindless shells, and the innocent among us caught in the crossfire as the guards fire indiscriminately into the Quarantine Zone, desperate to contain a nightmare birthed on our soil. How have we reached a point where our own government has rendered us expendable? We are not the enemy; we are the victims of a tragic miscalculation, of decisions made by men beyond our reach.
> Today, the stench of hopelessness hangs heavy in the air. Families seek refuge, only to find chaos, misunderstanding, and a future that seems to recede with every passing day. We are not just survivors—we are the forgotten, a testament to the frailty of civilization and the dire consequences of hubris.
> Kentuckians have always been resilient, known for our sense of community and our unwavering hope. But now, as our government turns a blind eye, it becomes imperative for us to unite against this monstrous threat, not just from the infection, but from the chilling silence of abandonment. While we may be isolated, we are not alone in our struggle. Together, we must ensure our voices rise above the chaos, reminding the world that we are still here—demanding recognition, urging for intervention, and holding on to the hope that we can reclaim our lives amidst this devastation. In this fight for our very survival, we must become both our own rescuers and a clarion call for a world that must not forget the humanity that still exists within our borders.

**Opinion Piece: Watching the American Dream Fade Away**

From the sunny shores of the West Coast, it feels surreal to witness the unraveling of a nation we once took pride in, now teetering on the brink of collapse. The infection that has gripped the East Coast is no longer a distant nightmare—it has become a tangible threat, casting a long shadow over our way of life. What was once an issue confined to a quarantined zone is now knocking at our doors, and the silence from our leaders is deafening.

As reports trickle in, detailing the horrors unfolding to our East, it’s impossible not to feel a creeping dread. Families, friends, and beloved communities are torn apart by a chemical monstrosity that has twisted ordinary people into soulless husks, driven only by an insatiable hunger. We watch in disbelief as our fellow Americans are abandoned, their cries for help met with indifference and isolation. The very fabric of our nation is disintegrating before our eyes, while our government responds with apathy rather than action. 

Here on the West Coast, we’ve prided ourselves on our progressive values, our sense of community, and our readiness to embrace diversity. But as the infection spreads ever closer, I can't help but question what happens when that compassion is tested. Will we turn a blind eye to those in desperation, or rally together to combat this monstrous threat not just to our health, but to our humanity? We must not forget that every person infected represents a family that once thrived, a community that now stands in ruins, and an American dream that has become a nightmare.

Moreover, the ramifications of this crisis extend far beyond our borders. The rest of the world watches, weighing their responses, and many nations are already taking measures to fortify their borders against us. We are at risk of becoming the pariah state, and that reality stings. Yet, even as we brace for the backlash from other countries, we must also confront the harsh truth that we may be left without support when we need it most. 

As we consider our collective future, I urge my fellow Americans on the West Coast to act. Let’s be the voice that demands accountability from our leaders, the force that offers kindness to those fleeing desperation, and a beacon of hope in a landscape that feels irrevocably altered. Our strength lies not in our isolation, but in our ability to empathize, to rise above fear, and to remember that we are all connected by the same ideals of liberty, justice, and humanity. The infection may seek to sever those ties, but if we act decisively and compassionately, we might just prove that the American spirit is not so easily extinguished. The time to unite is now.
