Agent: Unknown, Virus or Prion proposed
P0LA: 4409 Preston Hwy, Louisville, KY 40213
P0TA: 1249 PM EDT - 12/21/12
Transferal via: blood, saliva

The Louisville Infection will progress into at least Stage 1 Infection within 48 hours of initial internal contact to an Infection Source. Without immediate separation of contaminated and non-contaminated cells, the Infection is fatal in 100% of documented cases.

Progression through each Stage of Infection can take as much as 48 hours, or as few as 2 hours, and is variable based on the physiology of the Infected. At Stage 3, a Louisville Infection Host (L.I.H.) will effectively die as their organs begin to fail. The Infection will continue to feed and spread through the now-descesed host and eventually continue into Stage 4.

Upon the Infection reaching Stage 4, a Louisville Infection Host (L.I.H.) will reanimate without the use of it's now ineffective internal structure and begin to wander their local area in search of sources of noise or smell.

Minimal testing suggests that a L.I.H has a significant advantage in these two fields compared to an average reasearcher, and becomes vocally and visually enranged when they detect the presence of non-L.I.H entities via these senses.

Once enraged, an L.I.H. will quickly and cognitively chase the source of it's rage and attack it, attempting grapple and bite it.

The most potent Infection Source of L.I.H. is blood, but other typical sources include latent bacteria on the Host's flesh, or in the saliva inexplicably still produced by their mouth.

| Type Name     | Aggression / Sense | Acceleration / Speed | Ablativity / Stamina | Detail                                                                                                                                                  |

| Zeta   (DL-1) | medium             | medium               | medium               | The most common class of Infected, *Zeta* spend the majority of their lifetime in horde with other stronger Infected.                                   |
| Delta  (DL-2) | high               | high                 | low                  | *Delta* class Infected are characterized by their consistent self-consumption and incredible speeds.                                                    |
| Theta  (DL-2) | low                | low                  | extreme              | The *Theta* class is characterized by an extreme overproduction of methane during digestion.                                                            |
| Gamma  (DL-3) | medium             | medium               | high                 | A *Gamma* class Infected is characterized by their greater physical cohesion.                                                                           |

| Lambda (DL-4) | high               | high                 | medium               | *Lambda* class Infected will gather and consume "lower" class Infected in a manner to repair or upgrade itself.                                         |
| Alpha  (DL-4) | high               | extreme              | high                 | An *Alpha* class Infected is most similar to the *Delta* class, but the *Alpha* Infected will consume other Infected to maintain its physical cohesion. |
| Omega  (DL-5) | extreme            | high                 | extreme              | The *Omega* class Infected are characterized by extreme physical growth, maintaining proportions while increasing physical ability.                     |
