The Louisville Infection will progress into Stage 1 Infection within 48 hours of initial internal contact to an Infection Source. Without immediate separation of contaminated and non-contaminated cells, the Infection is fatal in 100% of documented cases.

Progression through the Stages can take as much as 48 hours, or as few as 2 hours, and is variable based on the physiology of the Infected. At Stage 3, a Louisville Infection Host (L.I.H.) will effectively die as their organs begin to fail. The Infection will continue to feed and spread through the now-descesed host and eventually continue into Stage 4.

Upon the Infection reaching Stage 4, a Louisville Infection Host (L.I.H.) will reanimate without the use of it's now ineffective internal structure and begin to wander their local area in search of sources of noise or smell.

Minimal testing suggests that a L.I.H has a significant advantage in these two fields compared to an average reasearcher, and becomes vocally and visually enranged when they detect the presence of non-L.I.H entities via these senses.

Once enraged, an L.I.H. will quickly and cognitively chase the source of it's rage and attack it, attempting grapple and bite it.

The most potent Infection Source of L.I.H. is blood, but other typical sources include latent bacteria on the Host's flesh, or in the saliva inexplicably still produced by their mouth.
