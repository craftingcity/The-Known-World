Simpson was a high-ranking member of the Washington National Guard as the bombs fell. Upon recieving orders to retreat to Olympia, and abandon their base of operations in Tacoma, they refused. This refusal accompanied a statement declaring that the 'Kent Rangers Corps' does not recognize the National Guard as an official governmental body, as displayed by their lack of regard for human lifes.
