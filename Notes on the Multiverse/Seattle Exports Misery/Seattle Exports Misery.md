# Seattle Exports Misery
#### A man answers the phone. 
He was asleep moments ago, but he can never afford to miss a call. The person on the other end of the line begins to speak. As he listens, the man's expression sharpens from dazed slumber, first shaping into confusion, then realization, and finally, acceptance of defeat. He sits up from his bed.

"I understand."

He pours himself a drink. The ice in his glass has long melted since the night before, but his whisky will burn all the same. He shakes his head, smiling at whatever he's being told.

"Ah, no. Thank you, but that won't be necessary General. Yes. No, I will not - and be well, General."

The man ends the call. He grabs his drink, and stands from his bed, walking across his lavish bedroom towards the large window overlooking the city below him.

He coughs for a minute, and wipes a drop of blood from his mouth. Then he takes a drink. A very long drink. He knows that he will never enjoy another drink like this again. He finishes the glass, and sets it upon the window sill.

The man looks to the horizon. It is July 20th, 2015, and the sun rises upon both coasts of the United States of America.

##### How did we get here?
In a timeline much like our own, in the year 2006, a CIA operational team was sent to an unnamed settlement in Iraq, where they attempted to locate and disable a known Weapon of Mass Destruction. Operational Command quickly lost radio contact with the team, and secondary operations revealed little in regard to matter. The first operation's team members were declared MIA, and their bodies were never recovered.

Six years later, on December 21st, 2012, while people around the world were celebrating the theoretical end of the world - as based on misunderstandings of the Mesoamerican Long-Count Calendar - a chemical bomb was detonated over Louisville, Kentucky. Thousands died immediately, and tens of thousands more as the chemical agent spread. 

As the local government responded, they found that this was no simple explosive; whatever these chemicals were, they changed people into monsters, where their consciousness was supplanted by an insatiable hunger. The Kentucky National Guard began attempts to contain the hazard, firing upon anything within the Quarantine Zone - including uninfected survivors. Months passed, and eventually the Zone was somehow breached. Kentucky was infected, and it was spreading this disease across the States.

Once the Kentucky Quarantine Breach reached international headlines, countries quickly revoked the privilege of transportation into or out of the States, Canada, and Mexico. Within the year, the international community had abandoned North America wholly.

As the infection spread, news from the East Coast came slower and slower, before stopping entirely. For almost two years, the States west of the Mississippi River lived as a remnant of America as it was before, until July 20th, 2015, when the international community launched a series of nuclear strikes across North America in an attempt to eliminate the possibility of spreading the infection any further. The concept of American Society collapsed in a fraction of a moment, coordinated by dozens of nations we once called allies, and now have no power to call our enemies.

We, the People of the Nuclear Wasteland, are alone. We were abused and abandoned, and we now wander the salted earth we called our home in fear.

Fear of nature. Fear of the other. Fear of the unknown.

Today's date is August 17th, 2015. It has been 30 days since the bombs dropped.

For 30 days, you drank water from puddles and faucets. You ate cans of beans and molding bread. You've seen people crack, crumble, and break under the pressure of survival - they distrust, they disbelieve, and they die. You may have defended yourself, more than once likely, or even been the desperate perpetrator, taking for your own what was once another's.

You need to move, to explore. You can't keep surviving, you need to *live*. You've gathered your little food, water, and gear, and you seek fulfillment.
