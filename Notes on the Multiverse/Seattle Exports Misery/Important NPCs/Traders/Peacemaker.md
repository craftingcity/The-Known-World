Peacekeeper is a member of INTERPOL, a subsidiary of the UN nowadays, and has deployed to the North American Wasteland, specifically Seattle, with a handful of contacts in Armories across the world. Being the man responsible for ordering the collection of airdrops and maintenance of armories, he is a powerful figure in Washington's Arms dealings.

Officially, he runs with members of the [[Tourist Paramilitary]], but his people maintain neutrality until otherwise requested of them.
