# Axioms of the Weave Arcane
1. **Conservationem Potentiale**
	- Known as the Axiom of Conservation, this axiom holds that Weave, in all forms, cannot be destroyed or created, only ever changed.
2. **Continua Fluxus**
	- Known as the Axiom of Continuity, this axiom holds that the Weave is in constant motion. 
	- Mortals experience this axiom as the passage of time!
3. **Fila Texere**
	- Known as the Axiom of Strands, this axiom holds that the Weave becomes shredded to strands against itself, which we perceive as observable reality as it flows through time. 
	- The concept of "Weave Potentia", as described in many alchemical texts, is derived from this axiom.
4. **Sutura Novum Significatio**
	- Known as the Axiom of Meaning, this axiom holds that one can manipulate the Strands described by Fila Texere and "sew new meaning" or create purposed effects from these Strands. 
5. **Nodum Inuocationem**
	- Known as the Axiom of Knots, this axiom holds that the Weave invokes "super-natural", "naturally disruptive", or "magical" effects when a Knot is created *or* released in the Weave.
	- This axiom is partly contested by the [[#Scree'up-Turring Theory Theory of Potential]], which proves that the Druidic claim that the Knots of the Weave are explicitly "super-natural" or "naturally disruptive" is false. 
	- Otherwise, the Axiom of Knots explains the basic concept of Weave Arcane, spellcasting, and reality.
6. **Density Exponentialibus**
	- Known as the Axiom of Density, this axiom holds that there is no theoretical limit on the density of a Knot in the Weave, only the practical ability to apply the force necessary to maintain the Knot as it becomes denser.

# Prevalent Theories of Arcana
## The Theory of a True Name
The Theory of a True Name comes from the Fey, but copies of texts written by Eladrin mages that speak of and explain this theory are kept in [[Cenva Minyo]]. It is claimed that something's name holds a complete power over that something. These two things are intrinsically & inversely linked, but a name is much easier to manipulate than anything generic, so long as you can access it. 

Ancient names are often hidden and well protected, but some fools give their names freely, often without meaning to do so, but still, this is enough to establish a complete control over them. This theory also posits the power of a False Name, one so powerful to hide your true name, is also incredibly powerful if not equally so. 

## The Theory of Faith
The Theory of Faith explains the existence of the Gods on Alaturmen and comes from [[The Texts Druidic]]. While this theory fails to explain extra-planar entities, it does hold true for the forces on Alaturmen. The theory has three simple parts.

> 1. Faith is a manifestation of a consciousness. 
> 2. Faith is deeply personal and inciting.
> 3. Faith knots the Weave.

[[The Texts Druidic]] then continue by explaining that these theoretical axioms of Faith explain the presence of the "Emotional Deities" who walk Alaturmen in forms material. Ostensibly, the personal manifestation of Knots creates these entities, and they grow in power by establishing more connections to or consumption of Faith.

## The Theory of Component
The Theory of Component too comes from [[The Texts Druidic]] and explains the near-necessity of Components in the manipulation of the Weave Arcane;

> In the creation of an effect of Weave Arcane, there are only so many things a mortal can perform.
> 
> 1. An attuned material focus one uses to gather *fila*.
> 2. An auditory focus one uses to harmonize *fila*.
> 3. A physical pattern one uses to bind *fila* against itself.
> 4. A will that one uses to manipulate *fila* into *significatio* as *nodum*.

Though the text itself does not mention any "component", popular parlance refers to these four "things a mortal can perform" as Components, and thus the theory gains its name. Individually, popular parlance names each of the four as Material, Verbal, Somatic, and Ability respectively.

## The Theory of Enchantment
The Theory of Enchantment originates in [[Sally Seashell]]'s "Calculating *Nodum Iterum*". In this book, she explains the ability for a practitioner to store a permanent or repetitive effect of Weave Arcane in a material manifestation. 

This process is technical, expensive, and incredibly exhausting as it involves the creation of a system of Knots that both produces the desired effect of the user, and after doing so, maintains or regains the ability to produce the desired effect. The first task is relatively easy, while the second is much more difficult.

## The Theory of Alchemy
To understand Alchemy at all, one must first understand the [[#Axioms of the Weave Arcane]]. After that, we can begin to speak about the Theory of Potential, or, more properly named, the Scree'up-Turring Theory. Again, after that, the theory of Alchemy continues to expand with Gunagido-Barrowinch Theory and their Motifs of Alchemy.

### Scree'up-Turring Theory / Theory of Potential
The Turring-Turring Theory was first published in "[[Natural Wonders of a Woven Reality]]", a thin booklet written in 062AF by [[Scree'up]] and [[Dimble Turing]]. This theory builds on the [[#Axioms of the Weave Arcane]] presented and proven in [[The Texts Druidic]], and postulates the following;

> Given the Axiom of Conservation and the Axiom of Continuity, one *must* wonder, if the Weave flows through all things, and can only ever be changed, doesn't this suggest that all things have the Weave flowing through them? As Axiom of Strands seems to directly state this, we could then further theorize that our observable reality *is* some type of Knot, as described in the Axiom of Knots, yet the Axiom of Knots excludes the possibility of the participation of the natural world in this "magic"; only the "naturally-disruptive" effects are the work of a Knot. 
> 
> One could then suggest that our observable reality is perhaps the work of a Knot unmade, but this suggestion *requires* the parallel suggestion that some force failed to maintain a Knot of such a Density that **Alaturmen** was formed. A Tetrimocal view of the world agrees with this suggestion; 'twas the work of Tetrimoc's fall, but this cannot be proven by citing any known works, including the *Diary of Tetrimoc*. 
> 
> Not only are the specifics of the Axioms a mess of contradiction, but the concept of invocation being a non-natural is provably false. The recipes following this chapter will describe to you the processes by which an arcane invocation of the Weave can be created. While it is clear that some effects could be enhanced with more specialized equipment, we suggest only four pieces in this book that we believe to be integral to an expanding toolkit of this practice, and we have also included one recipe that requires no specialized tools at all, though the effect when produced in this manner is quite minor.

### Gunagido-Barrowinch Theory
#### The Motifs of Alchemy
The Gunagido-Barrowinch Theory, also known as the the Motifs of Alchemy, describes twenty-nine "motifs" that are connected, mutable, and present in most if not all alchemically potent ingredients that one would encounter in [[Central Alaturmen]]. 

While this theory has yet to be popularized (or, in cannon, written down in one place; ~teehee), those few who have become Experts in this field almost unanimously agree that a dual categorization - one such as the Gunagido-Barrowinch Theory suggests - of alchemical ingredients is "efficient" or even "correct".

# Philosophies of Mages
(See [[How the Weave becomes Magic]])
## Traditionalist
A Traditionalist focuses their toolkit in a singular school or tradition of magic. Invokers, Diviners, Necromancers, or otherwise, those who focus their studies down one path you have followed for your entire life; you are a Traditionalist.
## Specialist
A Specialist focuses their toolkit for a specific task they perform. Enchanters, Alchemists, Artificers, Seductors - all specialists.
## Generalist
A generalist does not fall into either of the above categories. They focus their toolkit in what they have for what they must do, in most cases - simply to survive.
