# Mystical Military
In a setting that includes arcanology, theology, and mysticism as valid and efficient paths towards influence and power, our reflection of this fact in warfare is important to the diegesis our consumers experience. In the world of Alaturmen, magic is understood, but it is exponentially expensive. 

In an attempt at reasonable consistency, the following is assumed about Alaturmen's Magical Armies;
	- Given a population, a leader can raise 5-15% of them as levees.
	- Given a population, a leader has employed 0.5-3% of them as soldiers.
	- A leader will prepare their soldiers significantly more than their levees.
	- A leader can only consistently supply spells and magical effects of 2nd level or lower.
	- Characters of greater ability are considered 'Heroes', and cannot reasonably be included in a generic accounting of warfare.

Given the mechanics of our game-system, large-scale combats are simulated as a single, ratioed combat, where the grand conflict is reduced by the common denominator.

### Organization & Logistics
The traditional aspects of Organization & Logistics apply to a mystical military. Keeping your army fed and equipped for battle is necessary, and as such, so too is a significant logistics network. The majority of magical effects within the given restrictions provide insignificant change from a conventional organizational structure or that structure's logistics operations.

- *Message*; Given the range restriction on the generic invocation of this spell, Message is primarily used for internal squad communications.
- *Force Disk*, *Mage Hand*, *Unseen Servant*; Engineering & Logistics squads use a variety of minor magical effects to move larger volumes of equipment or materials as quickly as they could smaller volumes.
- *Local Sending*, *Skywrite*; Used by Field Commanders and Generals alike, the combination of a (non-extradimensional) Sending network for instant, long-range communications and Skywrite for mass information dissemination allows for consistent upkeep of important operational information.
- *Spare the Dying*, *Cure Wounds*, *Healing Spirit*, *Lesser Restoration*; Used by Medical personnel, magical healing - even within the consistency restrictions - allow for a dramatic decrease in the loss of 'true manpower' in a given army. While this can elongate the length of an individual battle, it's effect is most noticeable on the grand-strategy stage.

These simple effects allow for a mystical army to act in similarity to an army in our modern world - consistent communication, power-tooled logistics units, and life-saving medicines (or spells).

### Tactics & Strategy
In truth, 'Heroes' win wars. A Hero changes the tide of the most important engagement for their choice of victor. A Hero systemically removes key opposition, dismantling an enemy operation by removing it's leaders. Without 'Heroes', war is brutal, and long lasting. Communication and Divination foils operations moments before they become valuable, mystical healing allows soldiers to regain effect only hours after they were disabled, and the composition of the opposing force is predictable, but nearly always uncertain.

While a 'Hero' is present on the battlefield, the tactics of the opposing force must become irregularly adaptive, or they will falter and eventually fail. 

### Battlespace
#### Ground Warfare
The majority of wars fought on Alaturmen are fought on the ground. Armies take advantage of their local fauna, adopting cavalry units in their own style, or using combat-trained beasts alongside humanoid infantry.

Siege Equipment is the area of Ground Warfare that the presence of mysticism affects most, acting as a force multiplier for already effective equipment. 

#### Aerial Warfare
In Alaturmen, Aerial combat is a rarity. The majority of nations do not have access to the technology required to apply 'true' aerial doctrine. The most notable exception are the [[Golden Claws]], who do commonly employ Wyvern Riders as bombardiers, patrols, or conventional air-to-ground support units.

#### Naval Warfare
As compared to Aerial Warfare, Naval Warfare does not exist. Boats and Ships have defenses, but there has yet to be a true need for a navy for any major nation.

### Weapons of War
The majority of the weapons of a mystical war are simply more effective than those in conventional one. Blades remain sharper for longer, leverage is easier to apply, and unconventional weaponry is more conventional.

A prepared soldier may have access to slightly improved weapons and armor of their doctrine, and significantly more effective medicine and communication than their Levee counterparts.

Siege units could be equipped with improved equipment, or simply a powerful mystic.

Engineering and Medical Corps have efficient and effective equipment, allowing them to continue the war-machine for longer.
