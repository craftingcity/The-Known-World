Celestial is the homogenous and pre-historical language the Plane of [[Elysium]].

To all who do not understand it, Celestial sounds like a choir of thousands singing in high tones, and communicates meaning through this choir.

To those who do, Celestial is a horrible language to hear. With screeches that would harm a mortal's hearing and bellows that would rend souls asunder, Celestial understood is composed of only the extremes of possible audio-emotional communications.
