#### [[Malbolge]], Sixth Layer of Hell
The landscape of the layer is a steep, craggy, infinite incline that often experiences avalanches. Large fortress of copper are teardrop shapped to repel avalanches. Thoughout the plane, built along the slopes were pillars of adamantine that could support the avalanches, atop which platforms held suspended cages that held condemned devils. Prisoners were constantly injured by the incessant rockfalls, but never killed.
