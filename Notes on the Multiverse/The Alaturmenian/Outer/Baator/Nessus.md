#### [[Nessus]], Ninth Layer of Hell
The layer was a featureless plain with jagged edges that extend 2,500 miles from east to west and 1,100 miles from north to south, floating in an endless misty-red void. These plains are scarred by chasms and ravines several thousand miles deep, and were frequently ravaged by fiery storm winds.
