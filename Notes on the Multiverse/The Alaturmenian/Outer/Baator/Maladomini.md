#### [[Maladomini]], Seventh Layer of Hell
Maladomini is the seventh layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. It is an endless field of ruined and decaying cities and the center for all the bureaucracy of the Nine Hells. These cities are constantly being rebuilt and redestroyed on a quest for perfection.
