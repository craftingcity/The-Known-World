#### [[Cania]], Eighth Layer of Hell
Cania is a relentless realm of living cold. The layer is marked by moving glaciers and icebergs that drift as fast as a running person, constantly colliding with one another and with surrounding mountains of enormous sizes. Snow avalanches are common and violent. The weather is dominated by snow storms that howled with incessant winds. Thin layers of accumulated snow often hide deep crevasses that engulf incautious explorers.
