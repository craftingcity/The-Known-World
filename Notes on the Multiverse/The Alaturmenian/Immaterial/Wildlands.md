# Wildlands
## From Alaturmen to Beyond
The Wildlands are a fine protective plane that merges Alaturmen with the other #planes of the Multiverse.

#### To the Inner Planes
When passing this fine planar layer, if one enters with and maintains their focus, one emerges in an [[Inner]] plane of their choosing. If one fails to do so, they are cast about the planes, becoming thrust into the [[Elemental Planes]], the [[Astral Sea]], or, Gods forbid, an [[Outer]] plane such as [[Limbo]] or [[Abyss]].

#### To the Outer Planes
It is in this fine layer that a Alaturmenian Spirit waits for a ride on the River Styx to one of the [[Outer]] planes.
