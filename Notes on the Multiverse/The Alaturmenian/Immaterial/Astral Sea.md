# Astral Sea
## Soup of Primordials
The Astral Sea lies between the many planes of the multiverse as a sea of thought-form. This is the soup of creation, the land on which the Titans of the planes were born. 

Survival for mortal beings within the Astral Sea is much like life for those on the planes beyond, wherein Intelligence is a major factor in continued existence. Much of the physical material is considered "leakage" from the surrounding planes, and has been formed into civilization.

### River Styx
The River Styx is the immaterial inter-planar pathway that connects the many planes of the multiverse. The water of the river flows from beyond the planes, and is most commonly traversed by [[Karenos, River's Keeper]] and any lost souls Karenos has gathered.
