The Great Fires describe a twenty-year period of time when [[Its Greatness]] near indiscriminately burnt away all evidence of life. 

It spend ten years spreading outward throughout the western half of the [[Great Northern Forests]] before reaching what is now the clear terrain-marked border between [[The Holyl'nds]] and [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

[[Its Greatness]] spend another ten years retreating to what is now known as [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln|Kanielkiln]] and contained itself there. Soon the people would flock back to the [[The Holyl'nds]] and worship [[Its Greatness]] as their fickle master.

Only human and elven children under five were spared where the fire reached; of them, the surviving formed the faction [[Cenva Minyo]] and have sworn vengeance for their fallen parents.
