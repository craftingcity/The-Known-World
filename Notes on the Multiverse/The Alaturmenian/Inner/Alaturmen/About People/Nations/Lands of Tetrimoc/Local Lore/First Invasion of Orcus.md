# The Invasion of Orcus
## Written by [[Poppy Bumbleheart]]

# Chapter One - Nicolas, the Yellow Mage

On the eve of the first day of Still, in the 87th year after Tetrimoc had Fallen, a hum broke the sky. And all Orcus could do was smile.

Over the course of the following month, many dozens of magicians and scientists formed hypotheses about what this event was or meant, but only the Grey Ordeal knew, as the Old Man had warned only them. They traveled to the Deserts of Tetrimoc, only a half-week's ride by horseback from their Keep in Arthur's Prairie, meeting the Yellow Mage of the Guild of Wizards, in a dark and damp cave many miles north of the Golden City. His distain for his surroundings was visibly apparent in his posture and facial expression. The Yellow Mage huffed in greeting. 

"You should be glad for your Patron. Your record of employment with the Guilds would lead me to inquire about the nature of your requests if not outright deny them". He spoke with the same distain in his voice as he displayed outwardly, slithering between each word.

Tubric spoke confidently. "And yet you bring the book to us".

"And yet I do". One of the leathered hands of the mage reaches into his robe, and produces a thin book, hardbound in thick black leather, and locked by an adamantine hinge and clasp. He walks forward, and places the book into Eladrithal's grasp, who immediately passes it to Phnipper.

"Do not manage this tome lightly. The information contained herein is not to be replicated by anyone and not remembered by anyone other than yourselves." He turned to Phnipper. "Anyone."

She smiled, and quickly retorted "Got it! Is this *tome* gonna freak out when I do a magic about it?" and her smile grew cheshire in size as the Yellow Mage frowned. "I'm so glad we get to work together. Good seeing you Nicolas!"

The Yellow Mage turned from her and began to walk out of the cave before pausing, addressing the group.

"Do not fail your Patron." He states, before beginning to walk away again.

As the click of the Mage's boots began to fade, so too did the smile from Phnipper's face. She looked between her companions. "He said 'would' lead me to inquire. Does he really not know?"

"Aye. The Old Man was explicit, no one-" Tubric begins, before being cut off by Phnipper.

"-Needs to know until everyone needs to know, I know, I remember. I just wish he didn't feel like he needs to keep so many secrets."

Tubric paused a moment, before calmly replying, "Phnipper. We are not being tasked with keeping a secret. We are tasked with investigating the Hum. We are now one step closer, simply by holding that book within your hands. The Guilds are tasked with the well being of our united Coalition, enough work for the computers and councils, *this* is what we are here to be doing. The Wizards need not know until they need to know. And let us hope that they do not."

Phnipper takes a moment to consider Tubrics words, then nods. "Thank you for your wisdom Tubric. I understand, but I do not agree with it. We are using the resources of our allies without their truly informed consent."

Tubric returns Phnipper's nod - an unspoken agreement to disagree and continue.

Eladrithal speaks, his voice tender and bassy, "What's next then? I wouldn't mind visiting the Golden City, but that wouldn't be the best idea given our reputation with the Claws", pausing to shoot a knowing look at Tubric, "So maybe we head north-west. We'd likely make Agrandica's before nightfall." 

The rest of the Grey Ordeal agreed, and together they exited the cave, mounted their horses, and began their navigations.

# Chapter Two - Agrandica, the Northwestern Thief Lord

His assessment was correct, as it seemed always to be. The party reached their destination before nightfall, passing huts and teepees of wood and leather - the large leaved trees of the savanna providing a much desired barrier to the beating heat of the sun - before reaching the larger and more permanent structures in the center of Ahaustin. 

"I really don't want to see her again," Phnipper continued, "She never apologized for last time. I don't even think she's really sorry."

"She leads a gang nation at war with the world. Her apology would come with her own head on a pike." Eladrithal explained simply. "We work with assholes."

They continued in silence through the town, Eladrithal's statement driving the mood of the party towards a less casual posture. It wasn't long before they were halted by a few of Agrandica's soldiers. They didn't introduce themselves, but their fair clothing and many symbolic tattoos revealed their allegiance to the Red Madam.

Their horses and weapons were taken from them, and the party was led to a back-alley and down a set of rotting stairs. The stench of mildew and age flooded Eladrithal's senses causing him to cough as he and his companions are flung forward towards a table and chairs.

From the other side of the room, Agrandica moved to meet them there, pausing only for a moment as her chair is emplaced for her. 

"Greetings, my comrades, unfair as they may be." Her voice was kind, soft, and entirely hollow of genuine emotion. "I am under the assumption that you would not be so bold to come to me without purpose?"

Her smile filled her face, hollow as it was, betraying the only feeling she could truthfully claim to know - superiority.

Tubric returned her smile before reaching into his pack and producing a fist sized package, wrapped carefully in a dark grey-green fabric and placing it upon the table.

Agrandica's smile only widened at this sight.

Tubric continued, unwrapping the fabric and displaying the content of the package to be a stone. White in appearance, similar in transparency to a fine quartz, but upon peering inside, the interior looks to be infinitely fractal.
