# Golden Claws
## History
The *Golden Claws* have been the enforcement structure of [[The Golden City]] and the surrounding territories since the rise of [[Tetrimoc]] in the earliest years of Alaturmen's history. For a significant portion of time, they had direct evidence that they were performing the will of their master, but since his last appearance in 092AF, there has been no such evidence, and they have been willingly following the voice of their Ambassador, [[Houran Venclaw]], in his place, and quickly turned to corruption.

## Governance
### Class Capitalism
The Rule of Tetrimoc is a brutal capitalist class structure that keeps a select few people in power, [[#The Council of Eight]] specifically, and enforces their rules equally and explicitly non-equitably with the purpose of separating their people into incommunicable classes. 

##### City Dweller
The City Dwellers have the best life one can have under the *Golden Claws*; with opportunities galore, you must only prove yourself worthy of remaining here by maintaining your piety and your wealth. All you could want is within the sandstone walls of the city around you. You may even impress your master, [[Tetrimoc]], in your duties, and be afforded the opportunity to join his *Golden Claws*, and enforce his Rule. 

##### Topsider
The Topsiders live around [[The Golden City]], but not in it. Their life is work, and fight, and work again. Few Topsiders can afford to enter the City, let alone move into it and survive there. Instead, they find work in scavenging, hunting, and harvesting with a business they do not own. You have community, but little comfort, and the *Golden Claws* make your life harder than it has to be when they shake you down and take your hard-earned money.

##### Outlander
The Outlanders are the Enemy. They defy the Rule of Tetrimoc by living without the rules He has placed onto us. These people occupy the spaces away from the City, away from the light of our Lord. Often these people will lie, cheat, and steal, and some will go as far as to eat your body while you are still alive.

### The Council of Eight
The Council of Eight is the true ruling force of [[The Golden City]] and [[Lands of Tetrimoc]]. They are an oligarchy of eight people;
- [[Houran Venclaw]], Department of Relations; High Ambassador / Public Control
- [[Sivir Bagwell]], Hardened Scales; Gang Leader / Durandurm Control
- [[Ginger Ak-kizi]], Bloodbraids; Agave Farmer / Drug Control
- [[Boris Farrinik]] Department of Warfare; High General / Military Control
- [[Sakharov Yosimmite]] Department of Ecology; High Ecologist / Fuel Control
- [[Henrik Flour]] Department of Labor; Mine Baron / Metal Control
- [[Alaster Kobain]] Department of Warfare; Wyvern Keeper / Wyvern Control
- [[Porman Gwanna]] Department of Labor; District Manager / Wealth Control

#### Department of Relations
The Department of Relations is responsible for the communication of information between departments, cities, and other nations. The Department of Relations also acts as the 'internal affairs' service when complaints are officially raised against a Department.

#### Department of Ecology
The Department of Ecology is responsible for the production of food and drink for the population of [[The Golden City]], as well as performing research into the flora and fauna of [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]]. They are additionally responsible for the management of the communal needs of the society, such as waste disposal and water management.

#### Department of Labor
The Department of Labor is responsible for the importation, exportation, or production of any non-food, non-water commodities, and the management and expansion of the physical structures of [[The Golden City]].

#### Department of Warfare

##### The Golden Claw Guard
The guards of the city are the cultural superiors of all people of [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]] and act as their physical and lawful protectors and enforcers. Typically, guards are recruited among the City Dwellers, who already have a distain for their kindred above-ground, and trained by members who have seen active duty.

##### Gleeming Wyvern Riders
##### Breakers in Tooth and Claw
##### The Black Hand Killteams
In the bowels of the Golden City, there are many rough, tough, young, and unmissed children who have been indoctrinated into a military cult that operates outside the Deserts with extreme secrecy.
