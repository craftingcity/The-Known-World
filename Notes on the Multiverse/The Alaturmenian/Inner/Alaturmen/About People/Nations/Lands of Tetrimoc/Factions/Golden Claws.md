# Golden Claws
## History
The *Golden Claws* have been the enforcement structure of [[The Golden City]] and the surrounding territories since the rise of [[Tetrimoc]] in the earliest years of Alaturmen's history. For a significant portion of time, they had direct evidence that they were performing the will of their master, but since his last appearance in 092AF, there has been no such evidence, and they have been willingly following the voice of their Ambassador, [[Houran Venclaw]], in his place, and quickly turned to corruption.

## Governance
### Class Capitalism
The Rule of Tetrimoc is a brutal capitalist class structure that keeps a select few people in power, [[#The Council of Eight]] specifically, and enforces their rules equally and explicitly non-equitably with the purpose of separating their people into incommunicable classes. 

##### City Dweller
The City Dwellers have the best life one can have under the *Golden Claws*; with opportunities galore, you must only prove yourself worthy of remaining here by maintaining your piety and your wealth. All you could want is within the sandstone walls of the city around you. You may even impress your master, [[Tetrimoc]], in your duties, and be afforded the opportunity to join his *Golden Claws*, and enforce his Rule. 

##### Topsider
The Topsiders live around [[The Golden City]], but not in it. Their life is work, and fight, and work again. Few Topsiders can afford to enter the City, let alone move into it and survive there. Instead, they find work in scavenging, hunting, and harvesting with a business they do not own. You have community, but little comfort, and the *Golden Claws* make your life harder than it has to be when they shake you down and take your hard-earned money.

##### Outlander
The Outlanders are the Enemy. They defy the Rule of Tetrimoc by living without the rules He has placed onto us. These people occupy the spaces away from the City, away from the light of our Lord. Often these people will lie, cheat, and steal, and some will go as far as to eat your body while you are still alive.

The public government begins with the Golden Claw Enforces; the boots on the ground. They report to their Captains at their Garrisons throughout [[The Golden City]] and the holdings under their protection. Those Captains report to [[Boris Farrinik]] of [[#The Council of Eight]]. 

### The Council of Eight
The Council of Eight is the true ruling force of [[The Golden City]] and [[Lands of Tetrimoc]]. They are an oligarchy of eight people;
- [[Houran Venclaw]], Department of Relations; High Ambassador / Public Control
- [[Sivir Bagwell]], Hardened Scales; Gang Leader / Durandurm Control
- [[Ginger Ak-kizi]], Bloodbraids; Agave Farmer / Drug Control
- [[Boris Farrinik]] Department of Warfare; High General / Military Control
- [[Sakharov Yosimmite]] Department of Ecology; High Ecologist / Fuel Control
- [[Henrik Flour]] Department of Labor; Mine Baron / Metal Control
- [[Alaster Kobain]] Department of Warfare; Wyvern Keeper / Wyvern Control
- [[Porman Gwanna]] Department of Economics; District Manager / Wealth Control

### The Golden Claw Guard
The guards of the city are the cultural superiors of all citizens of [[The Golden City]] and [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]] and their physical and lawful protectors and enforcers. Typically, guards are recruited from the upper middle class, lending precedent to the poor treatment of the lower classes throughout the south-west.

#### Breakers in Tooth and Claw

### The Black Hand Killteams
In the bowels of the Golden City, there are many rough and tough young and unmissed children who have been indoctrinated into a secret military cult that operates outside the Deserts with extreme secrecy.
