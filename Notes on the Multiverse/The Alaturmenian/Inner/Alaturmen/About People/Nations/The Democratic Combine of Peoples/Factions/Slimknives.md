# Slimknives
## History
#### Early History
The *Slimknives* became a prevalent force of information and brutal power directly after a series of assassinations in the far south-west, particularly in the city of [[Beacon]], around the late 40s and early 50s. No single person came forward claiming to have performed the murders, and their replacements were seemingly more acceptable. The perpetrators were never caught - and the Slimknives continued to grow.

They have expanded their influence beyond the area surrounding Beacon into a de-jure Barony of [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], and come to be led by the ruthless [[Baron Avory]] in the late 70s, as the Combine was founded. 

#### The First Century
In the coming years, as the Combine settled into cooperative ceasefire under the pressure of the outside world, the Slimknives continued their brutality. Acting as what could be considered the world's first 'private military company' - a genuine army for hire, as apposed to the roaming and curious mercenary - the Slimknives entered conflicts in [[The Old|Minyostalma]], [[The Golden City]], and the [[Illburn Forest]] under false identification, participating as 'a member of the company'. The name stuck among the interacting communities, presenting The Company as a mysterious independent entity.

Sometime in 104AF, it became clear and official that both the [[Dampguard]] and the [[Riphounds]] had become aligned with the Slimknives under the [[SEASEC|South-Eastern Alliance of Security]], which nearly immediately assumed the role of the once-false-now-born 'The Company', along with it's colloquial name.
