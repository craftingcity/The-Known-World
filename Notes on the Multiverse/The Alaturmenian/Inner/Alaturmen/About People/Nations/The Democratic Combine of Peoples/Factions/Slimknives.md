# Slimknives
## History
The *Slimknives* became a prevalent force of information and brutal power directly after a series of assassinations in the far south-west, particularly in the city of [[Beacon]], around the late 40s and early 50s. No single person came forward claiming to have performed the murders, and their replacements were seemingly more acceptable. The perpetraters were never caught - and the Slimknives continued to grow.

They have expanded their influence beyond the area surrounding Beacon into a de-jure Barony of [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], and come to be led by the ruthless [[Baron Avory]] in the late 70s, as the Combine was founded.
