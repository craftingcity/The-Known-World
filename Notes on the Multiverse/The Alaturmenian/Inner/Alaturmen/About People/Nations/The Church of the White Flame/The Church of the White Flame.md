# The Church of the White Flame
![[Holy-100AF.png]]
*the area of [[The Holyl'nds]]*

## History
The [[#The Church of the White Flame]] is the main body of government in the [[The Holyl'nds]], as a caste theocracy. They worship [[Its Greatness]] as a great force to be revered for its allowance of containment. 

## Governance
### Castes
The Church of the White flame practices Power-Imbalance-Gaslighting as mechanics of its culture and as in deference to its genuine god [[Its Greatness]], who wills this to be the way the church is run, as his Spoken have indicated though their words and powers.

##### Spoken
The Spoken of [[Its Greatness]] are the few who have claimed to have literally communicated with their patron deity. They are the most proficient divine casters of the nation, but this is the only evidence of their connection with [[Its Greatness]], as this communication cannot be verified in public. These people act as the highest level of government, who demand and receive immediate and unending reverence. Roughly a dozen individuals claim and hold the title at any given time.

##### Firstchurch
The Firstchurch are the high priests of the Church and act as the main members of the governmental body of the Church. Firstchurch are born and raised into the position, most of the caste has never left [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]], allowing the previous generation to imbed the fascistic hate of their lessers into the new one.

Beyond their lawmaking, educating, and propagandizing obligations, certain members of the Firstchurch are granted the titles of higher responsibilities.

###### Guardians
The Guardians are responsible for the safety of the Young Tendered within Kanielkiln. They are not considered a primary educator for the purposes of formal education - although many choose to perform tutoring duties - but for enforcing the rigid control of the body and minds of the Young Tendered in their care.

###### Imparteers
Imparteers are the members of Firstchurch blessed with the duty of carrying a portion of *The First Removed* ('Minyosat' - flame shared) and imparting it upon Tendered of the Church.

###### Collectors
The Collectors use their connection to discern absolute truth of Tendered and Patrons, most particularly in the case of Law Enforcement and Revenue Collections.

##### Tendered
The Tendered of the Church are the middle class of the Church, acting as the owners and masters of business or the local leaders of temples. The major portion of revenue any Tendered collects is given to the Church, either in the form of local developments or genuine monetary tithe. Some Tendered, like their betters, undertake extra responsibility in the management of the *Unseen*, detaining unclaimed *Undesireables* and 'training' them into compliance under [[#The Ideology Correction Corps]].

##### Patron
The Patron are those who attend the establishments of their Tendered. They attended to duties assigned to them by those Tendered. While the Patron are considered free folks, they are forcibly required to attend to those duties or provide compensation of greater value under threat of law.

##### Unseen & Undesirables
The Unseen are slaves. They perform duties requested of them by their betters under threat of torture and death. They are typically claimed by a particular house sigil and an identification code.

Undesirables are non-human, non-elven people who are in territories of the Church and are unclaimed as Unseen. These people will be tortured into compliance by [[#The Ideology Correction Corps]], or murdered, reprocessed, and then fed to the more obedient.

### The Homeland Force
The **Homeland Force** acts as the reserve military of the Church. The **Homeland Force** is an attractive option for many, as it offers piety and prosperity for commitment and training. While attending to their training or otherwise 'inactive', members of the **Homeland Force** act in their typical duties.

The **Homeland Force** is one of the few ways that an *Unseen* or *Undesirable* can acquire a legal status that regards them as a real and full person. Acceptable service for four constant years grants a member of the **Homeland Force** a 'Silver Medal', which, for some, is redeemed for wealth, but for others carries life-changing social and legal status while carried. 

#### White Flame Militants & WhiteTech
The **White Flame Militants** are a selective sub-branch of the **Homeland Force** that is responsible for the containment and minimization of any and all threats posed by [[The Old]].

A section of their bugeting goes to research and development of technology for and of [[The Old|Minyostalma]] under the name **WhiteTech**.

### Holy Crusaders of Truth and Light
The **Holy Crusaders of Truth and Light** is the active military branch of the Church. Led by the *Spoken* themselves, the **Holy Crusaders** pursue invasions against heretics, loose casters, and other enemies of the Church. 

Service under the **Holy Crusaders** is a privilege. The best of the **Homeland Force** are recruited, trained further, and integrated into an army led by one of four *Spoken*-Generals. While historical planar invasions have slowed the progress against their mortal enemies, the Crusaders have claimed victory against the [[Bandit Lords]], and are currently participating in the [[Northern Conflicts, c.105af]] and attacks against the 'heretical' presences in the far west.

Given that war is not a truly public affair in the Church's culture, the presence of the **Slave Corps** is notably omitted from history despite their necessary and grand contributions in the Holy Crusader's victories.

### The Ideology Correction Corps
Founded circa 07XAF, the Ideology Correction Corps serves as a core function of the ecosystem of the Church. The purpose of the ICC is two-fold. First and foremost, the ICC was founded as a business dealing in slave-labor. Secondarily, the ICC investigates avenues towards increasing the quality, efficiency, and supply of that slave-labor.

The ICC has become a monopoly since its founding. The majority of the slave-owning population purchased the people they own from the ICC itself, or a "competing" company they've bought out. Developments in their second purpose include "Caloric Recycling", "Integrated Ideology", and most recently "Ritual Repopulation".

In addition to the "traditional generating slave population", the ICC has been trying to generate a supply of "perfect slaves". [[The Assault of the Giant Dissenters]] has solved a severe issue in this regard in the Orcish people, who are created by ritual - an inherently replicable and mutable process.

Since this development, over the course of hundreds of rituals - experiments have since produced two "viable" clutches. The first clutch was created circa 103AF while using the tendrils of [[Its Greatness]] to heat the caldron for the ritual. This clutch aged abnormally quickly, presenting a stark contrast between those who could accept and adapt to their circumstances and those who could not. Graduates of the first clutch have been granted 'Silver Medals' and released into the public under constant surveillance. The second clutch was created three years later, c. 106AF, where the first successful ritual was reproduced with the addition of fiendish blood. While the second clutch failed to produce obedient slave population, it was successful in creating a series of powerful military assets.

## Culture
### The Truth
 > "The Great White Flame is not a "god" as you put it. When The Great Flame made armageddon of our holyl'nd many perished as non-believers. We are not fools. It is our master, not our god." - [[Gimish, of Firstchurch]]

[[Its Greatness]] looks upon you as you look upon it. 
Its Greatness judges you as you judge it. 
Its Greatness bestows unto you as you worship it.
Its Greatness is holy, right, and a gift to us.
We will share our gifts with the world.

### The Formal Journey
The Tendered are a priest class in the society of [[The Holyl'nds]]. Traditionally, they are taken at a young age to [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]] and raised by the Firstchurch. When they are "ready" or their training is otherwise complete, they begin their formal journey; They are ordained in filigree by their *Guardian* and ascend the 100 steps into the White Church. They are to be greeted by the Spoken of the church and given their flame. They then depart from the city in parade and glory. They will carry with them their flame where they go and tend it. Many start churches of their own and grow the flock of Patrons from the Unseen. Some settle otherwise, starting businesses, charities, or other organizations.

#### Heritage
The majority of the heritage of the church lies in the first contact between the Elven settlers and the Human fieldborn.

#### Language
The members of the Church are lawfully required to speak [[Fanyaquestan (language)]] in public, unless they are performing translations in diplomatic settings.
