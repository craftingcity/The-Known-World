War comes to the North of Alaturmen, and it brings with it promises of freedom and safety - for both sides. [[The Church of the White Flame]] has come under attack by [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] due to theological differences and the generalized incentive to expand one's empirical power.

## The Inciting Incident
#### 105AF/05/03
As coordinated by [[Moses the Brave]], the Grand Poo-bah of [[Wychway]], [[Jorrin Bearscarred]], and the Adventurer King, [[Arthur Simonson]], were made to meet sometime before the 3rd of Replowing in the 105th year, in the town of [[Buqyr]]. There, they made formal preparations for the secession  of the Province of Wychway from [[The Church of the White Flame]] to [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

On the morning of the 3rd, forces from the Delectus Chapter of [[Arthur's Knights]] arrived in [[Wychway]] to find 'absolutely no resistance', as Wychway's Church-aligned military forces had been directed to support the Church's efforts against "heretics" in their northwest.

## First Battle of Kohnstamm
#### 105AF/05/08 - 05/15

The Arthurian Push continued westward, towards [[Kohnstamm]] and it's surrounding area. The Delectus Chapter Knights were reportedly joined by the '1st Revolution Infantry' of [[Wychway]]. Upon reaching the surrounding settlements, the Arthurian Forces faced significant resistance. The Church's soldiers would ambush the incoming force by occupying the previously evacuated civilian buildings and having a portion of their own forces disguise as civilians.

The Arthurian forces attempted to rally and centralize their force, but the Church had already done too much damage to them, and the survivors would instead be forced to flee from the battle.

## Battle of the Bridge, Wychway
#### 105AF/05/18 - 05/21

As quickly as the Arthurians struck, so too did the Church strike back. The Church rallied its forces from the north and attempted to surround the city of Wychway as the Arthurian forces recovered. As the Church's army approached, the battle commenced. While supported by the city walls, the Arthurian forces performed poorly in their initial engagement, and began to fall back into the city via bridge. The Church's forces followed, and as the final Arthurian soldier cleared the bridge, it was immolated, along with all the Church forces on the bridge. 

As Syr Grain of Wychway's 1st Revolutionary Infantry spoke on the event, he said "[the Church's force] kept running after us, and we got them back for their bullshit in Kohnstamm. They all got what they deserved. We hit all the runners, thank the Gods. We cleared all of 'em after too, with their idol-worship undead bullshit."

## First Battle for the Centers
#### 105AF/06/12 - 07/18

After committing time to repairs and rearmament, the Arthurian forces moved from their positions in [[Wychway]] into the [[Central Holyl'nd]], attempting to expand their control of the region. While there were minor victories over the course of many battles, the First Battle for the Centers ended with more lost than gained on either side. The Arthurian forces would fall back into the [[South Littemotto]], where they would regroup, preparing for further conflict.

## Second Battle of Kohnstamm 
#### 105AF/07/19 - 07/21

In an honor-driven attempt to reconnoiter [[Kohnstamm]], Chapter Delectus and a group of volunteers split from the larger group returning to [[Wychway]] and are caught out by a section of an oncoming assault force coming from [[Kohnstamm]]. The resulting battle was concise, favoring the Church's forces 10-to-1. The survivors, few as they were, retreated under the command of Chapter Delectus' Knights back into [[Wychway]], and relayed the news of the oncoming assault.

## Battle of Wychway
#### 105AF/07/21 - 09/04

With the few hours granted by the now fleeing Chapter Delectus, the city of [[Wychway]] is prepared for siege - the outer edges are rushed inward, the citizenry secured within the walls of the Bearscarred Castle, and alchemical reserves are quickly depleted in an effort to force an advantage. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th Slave Corps begin the assault, joined by Kohnstamm's 4th Infantry Company and Odaya's 6th Infantry Company only after the Slave Corps face the brunt of the initial defense, and the siege began.

Over the next 33 days, the 4th and 6th Infantry Companies were successfully resupplied and reinforced twice, against the best efforts of the forces of [[Wychway]]. The siege would come to be broken by the Chapter Proprius, as they and the Arthurian's 22nd Volunteer Company reinforced the 1st Revolutionary Infantry and repelled the invaders.

With significant loss, the city of Wychway remains, bolstered in fervor against [[The Church of the White Flame]].

## Second Battle for the Centers
#### 105/08/05 - 106/02/10

Chapter Rectio leads the Arthurian forces into the Second Battle for the Centers in the Autumn, with the tactical aim of crippling the Church's harvest-stores before the Winter comes to slow the war. Accompanying the Chapter Rectio were the 23rd, 24th, and 25th Volunteer Companies and the Cenvan 3rd Ranger Company.

The Arthurian forces were tasked with a second invasion of the [[Central Holyl'nd]], with a direct focus on the capture of [[Tanniweh]], [[Lavas]], and [[Momiyach]] for their positional value. Utilizing the Cenvan 3rd as forward scouts, Chapter Rectio would take all three towns in quick succession, posting the 23rd, 24th, and 25th in garrison at each town. 

[[The Church of the White Flame]] would respond forcefully, calling the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Infantry Corps into response, with support from the 6th Slave Corps and eventually, the 1st Augmented Corps. The coming battles would last into the Winter, when the fighting would slow, but not cease.

## Immolation of Odaya
#### 106/02/02 - 02/08

During the long and attritious [[#Second Battle for the Centers]], Cenva Minyo would send their 1st and 4th Ranger Companies into the city of [[Odaya]]. Being largely undefended, the Cenvan Rangers found little resistance to their assault. The attack left [[Odaya]] and its surrounding townships severely damaged, if not completely destroyed. The 1st and 4th Ranger Companies would then retreat to regroup with the 3rd Ranger Company in [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln|Kanielkiln]] and support the ongoing efforts there.

## The Black Battle of Kanielkiln
#### 106/02/10 - cur

As the [[#Second Battle for the Centers]] continues, the Arthurians stand strong in their position even as they face heavy losses against the Church forces, the 1st Auxiliary Corps in particular. As Arthurian reinforcements arrive in the form of the 1st and 4th Ranger Companies, the 22nd Volunteer Company, and the Chapter Proprius, the tide of battle turned favorable. With the Arthurian positions intact, the Church forces of the 1st and 2nd Infantry Corps, as well as the 1st Augmented Corps, would retreat into [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]].

After a reorganization, the Arthurian forces would begin an assault on Kanielkiln; the Cenvan Ranger Companies would be tasked with the encirclement of the city as the Knights and the Infantry would assault the eastern entrance of the city. 

While the initial assault proved fruitful, as the Arthurians quickly breached the eastern wall, progress became terribly slow. Through no fault of the Arthurians, they continued to face losses against the 1st Auxiliary Corps and the positions they support.

Forced to retreat, the survivors of the 1st, the 3rd, and the 4th Ranger Companies, and of the Chapters Proprius and Rectio would return to [[Lavas]], having become the functional Headquarters of the fielded forces, and lie in a painful combination of waiting for allied support and fighting savage skirmishes, desperate to hold this advantage for their Kingdom.

## The First Battle on the Firelight Sea
#### 106/04/17 - 04/18

The north-western shore of the [[Actstow Hills]] has always been a strategic resource for [[Cenva Minyo]]. In addition to its role as potent industrial production, the access to the [[Firelight Sea]] has blessed the region with one of the world's few active ports: the Salt Board Harbor of [[Hameer]]. Since the coming of the Conflict, the Salt Board Harbor has been defended by a standing guard and a series of mystical and mechanical defenses. They have been prepared.

On the night of the 17th day of Weeding, a fleet of three large warships, the A.W.C. *Valor*, A.W.C. *Tithe*, and A.W.C. *Immolation*, together sailed east from the [[Yagil]] Naval Yard towards the [[Actstow Hills]]. As the fleet came within 3 miles of the shore, they began to maneuver into a line formation in preparation for their insertion upon the river, though this insertion would never come. During the maneuver, a massive burst of sound is produced on the shore of the [[Actstow Hills]]; the A.W.C. *Tithe* was struck by a massive metallic missile that, upon impact with the warship, exploded, shredding the ship's hull, and rendering the vessel scuttled and sinking. 

As mission command failed to prepare for the loss of one of their warships before it had reached the shores, the response from the fleet was unorganized. The *Valor*, true to it's name, would follow through with their part of the maneuver, coming into position heading into the river, while the *Immolation* would quickly turn out of formation to fire rounds of futile retaliatory cannon-blasts. Then, accompanied by the loud boom coming from the shore and a screaming whistle moments before, the A.W.C *Valor* explodes, sending flaming shrapnel and dismembered corpses into the Sea below.

The A.W.C *Immolation* would continue it's turn, facing west, and would begin to flee, returning to port in [[Yagil]] on the morning of the 18th.
