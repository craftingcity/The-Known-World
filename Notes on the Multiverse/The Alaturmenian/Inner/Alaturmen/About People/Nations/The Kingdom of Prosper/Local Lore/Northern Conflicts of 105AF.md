War comes to the North of Alaturmen, and it brings with it promises of freedom and safety - for both sides. [[The Church of the White Flame]] has come under attack by [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] due to theological differences and the generalized incentive to expand one's empirical power.

## The Inciting Incident
#### 105AF/05/03
As coordinated by [[Moses the Brave]], the Grand Poo-bah of [[Wychway]], [[Jorrin Bearscarred]], and the Adventurer King, [[Arthur Simonson]], were made to meet sometime before the 3rd of Replowing in the 105th year, in the town of [[Buqyr]]. There, they made formal preparations for the secession  of the Province of Wychway from [[The Church of the White Flame]] to [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

On the morning of the 3rd, forces from the Delectus Chapter of [[Arthur's Knights]] arrived in [[Wychway]] to find 'absolutely no resistance', as Wychway's standing military had been directed to support the Church's efforts against "heretics" in their northwest.

## First Battle of Kohnstamm
#### 105AF/05/08 - 05/15

The Arthurian Push continued westward, towards [[Kohnstamm]] and it's surrounding area. The Delectus Chapter Knights were reportedly joined by the '1st Revolution Infantry' of [[Wychway]]. Upon reaching the surrounding settlements, the Arthurian Forces faced significant resistance. The Church's soldiers would ambush the incoming force by using the previously evacuated civilian buildings and having a portion of their own forces disguise as civilians.

The Arthurian forces attempted to rally and centralize their force, but the Church had already done too much damage to them, and the survivors would instead flee from the battle.

## Battle of the Bridge, Wychway
#### 105AF/05/18 - 05/20

As quickly as the Arthurians struck, so too did the Church strike back. The Church rallied its forces from the north and attempted to surround the city of Wychway as the Arthurian forces recovered. As the Church's army approached, the battle commenced. While supported by the city walls, the Arthurian forces performed poorly in their initial engagement, and began to fall back into the city using the bridge. The Church's forces followed, and as the final Arthurian soldier cleared the bridge, it was immolatted, along with all of the Church forces on the bridge. 

As Syr Grain spoke on the event, he said "[the Church's force] kept running after us, and we got them back for their bullshit in Kohnstamm. They all got what they deserved. We got to shoot down the runners too, thank the Gods. We cleared all of 'em after too, with their idol-worship bullshit."

## First Battle for the Centers
#### 105AF/06/02 - 07/08

After committing time to repairs and rearmament, the Arthurian forces moved from their positions in [[Wychway]] into the [[Central Holyl'nd]], attempting to expand their control of the region. While there were minor victories over the course of many battles, the First Battle for the Centers ended with more lost than gained on either side. The Arthurian forces would fall back into the [[South Littemotto]], where they would regroup, preparing for further conflict.
