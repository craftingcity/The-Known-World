War comes to the North of Alaturmen, and it brings with it promises of freedom and safety - for both sides. [[The Church of the White Flame]] has come under attack by [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] due to theological differences and the generalized incentive to expand one's empirical power.

## The Inciting Incident
#### 105AF/05/03
As coordinated by [[Moses the Brave]], the Grand Poo-bah of [[Wychway]], [[Jorrin Bearscarred]], and the Adventurer King, [[Arthur Simonson]], were made to meet sometime before the 3rd of Replowing in the 105th year, in the town of [[Buqyr]]. There, they made formal preparations for the secession  of the Province of Wychway from [[The Church of the White Flame]] to [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

On the morning of the 3rd, forces from the Delectus Chapter of [[Arthur's Knights]] arrived in [[Wychway]] to find 'absolutely no resistance', as Wychway's standing military had been directed to support the Church's efforts in their northwest.
