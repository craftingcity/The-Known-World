"His Greater Plan" is not exactly one text, but rather a collection of propaganda distributed by the [[Noble Houses of Prosper]] that the Immortal King, [[Arthur Simonson]], has a grand plan for each and every citizen, which may require certain sacrifices from some and others from others.

For the most part, this is a play by the [[Noble Houses of Prosper]] to hold the [[Arthur Simonson|King Of Prosper]] in similar station to [[Its Greatness]] of [[The Church of the White Flame]], and the humble King makes an active effort to dissuade his citizenry of this notion; "I am but a Man", so he says.
