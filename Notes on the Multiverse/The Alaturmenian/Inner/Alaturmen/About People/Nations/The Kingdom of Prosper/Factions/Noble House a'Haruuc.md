# Noble House a'Haruuc
## History
## Governance
### Nova Manus Dei
It is the task of the a'Haruuc House to make the kingdom ready for war at a moment's notice. They hold minimal property considering their station, and rather are groomed to position in [[Arthur's Knights]]. Their crest is a round disk floating above a humanoid figure, casting it in shadow.
