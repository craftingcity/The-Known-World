### Chapters
##### Chapter Proprius
The **Chapter Proprius** is held in the highest regard among Arthur's Knights. They stand in defense of [[Castle Prosper]], and [[Arthur Simonson|The Great Adventurer King]] himself.

They bear a flag and tabard of their crest, a four-pointed star contained by four solid dots implying a square, and the Chapter is adorned in tall, long-pointed armors.

##### Chapter Constantia
The **Chapter Constantia** stands in defense of the area east of [[Castle Prosper]] and south of [[Magius]]. In their public capacity, they act as an '*Auxiliary Support Chapter*' in the case that either **Chapter Proprius** or **Chapter Fides** are called to action, leaving time to care for a large portion of the relics of the [[Unification]]. In their private capacity, they keep and care for the Guild Containment Vault 2.

They bear a flag and tabard of their crest, a sword crossing a shield below the thin crown of their King, and the Chapter is adorned in curt, modular armors.

##### Chapter Delectus
The **Chapter Delectus** defends the city of [[Yerba]], and is the Chapter with the most commonly experiencing 'peace-time' conflict in the form of border skirmishing, bandit hunting, and wrangling adventurers.

They bear a flag and tabard of their crest, a skull and crossbones wearing the thin crown of their King `check for consistency` , and the Chapter is adorned in thick, spiked armors.

##### Chapter Fides
The **Chapter Fides** stands in defense of the city of [[Magius]], and is often the Chapter granted the obtrusive luxury of performing experimental warfare, both in simulation and in practice. 

They bear a flag and tabard of their crest, an eight-pointed star, where the cardinal points are half the size of the diagonals, and the Chapter is adorned in gothic, curving armors.

##### Chapter Probitas
The **Chapter Probitas** defends [[Janesland]] and the agreed borders with the [[Blood Clans]]. They are held in high regard for their historic participation during the [[Unification]].

They bear a flag and tabard of their crest, a skull imposed over a four pointed star wearing the crown of their King, and the Chapter is adorned in strong, straight armors.

##### Chapter Rectio
The **Chapter Rectio** stands in defense of both [[Gambleum]] and [[Moonlight]], and yet is held in the lowest regard among Arthur's Knights. Underutilized in significant active duties, the Chapter has taken to performing duties for the [[Dwarven Kingdom Actstow]] and [[Cenva Minyo]].

They bear a flag and tabard of their crest, a black bull's head over a dimpled field, and the chapter is adorned in heavy, brutish armors.
