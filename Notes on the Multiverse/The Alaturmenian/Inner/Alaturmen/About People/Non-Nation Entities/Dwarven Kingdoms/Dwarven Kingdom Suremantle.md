# Suremantle Clan
## History
The Suremantle Clan is one of the most important and least heard-of families on the face of Alaturmen. While they are likely only known for their metal exports outside of their region, along the [[Deakred Range]], they are the final arbitrators.

For all of Alaturmen's history, the [[Deakred Range]] has been under the complete control of the Suremantle Clan. The Clan claims that they were the first Dwarves carved from the surface of Alaturmen. For the first forty years of Alaturmen's history, the Suremantle Clan spread and conquered the [[Deakred Range]] with little opposition, creating an atmosphere and culture of domination, subjugation, and isolationism.

From the fifties to the seventies, there were many skirmishes along the northern side of the [[Deakred Range]], including the regions of [[Litteortosta]], [[Sinazel Ambonas]], the [[Greenhilles]], and the [[Grumbling Hills]] against the many newly formed factions that since filled Alaturmen. 

These skirmishes were costly, both in resources and reputation, and due to "economic concerns", ie, the Northern Metals Trade, the Clan was forced to capitulate a significant portion of their claimed territory to the [[Guilds of Coalition]] - the areas south and east of the [[Lake of Eternal Life]] were no longer property of the Suremantles. 

Since the [[Northern Conflicts, c.105af]], the Suremantle Kingdom has begun to attempt to slowly and covertly push back into their once claimed territories.

## Governance
The Dwarven Kingdom Suremantle is an aristocratic-plutocracy that extends from the west of the [[Lake of Eternal Life]] in the [[Deakred Range]] to the beginning of the "far western mountains" beyond the [[Red Hills]] - the space north of [[Kailkeep]], and closest to the [[Wildlands]].

The King Suremantle stands at the head of the Council of Nobles, the predominant governmental body in [[Mountain Hall]]. Each of the Noble Houses holds responsibilities throughout the region.
