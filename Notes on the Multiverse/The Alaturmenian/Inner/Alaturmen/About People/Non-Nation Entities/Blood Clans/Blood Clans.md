# Northeastern Blood-Hobgoblin Clans
![[KingdomOfProsper-105AF.png]]
*[[Northeastern Central]] Alaturmen as of 105AF*
## History
In the time before time, the goblinoid were united as one. Thirty-two years after [[Tetrimoc]] fell, and after thirty-two years of subjugation by the [[Bandit Lords]], the Hobgoblin of the Eastern half of the [[Great Northern Forests]] wrote and signed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] declaring war upon any other. After the fall of the [[Bandit Lords]] and after many years, these Clans made peace with their newest neighbor; [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

Not long after this peace, they turned onto each other and they still fight in the [[Illburn Forest]] to the northeast of [[Arthur's Prairie]].

## Governance
The Clans are all independent, and govern themselves as they wish for the most part, but they all follow the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]], including structure and the like.

Each of the Clans is ruled by one Hobgoblin, the Mangugu, who answers to up to twelve Gurr'ix-Yuggwulp (advisor-concubines), and must be near three Alman (~bodyguards), at all times.

Six family names reside on the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]];

#### [[Simonson Clan]]
A elder-matriarchy of fierce militants. The [[Arthur Simonson|son]] of the [[Amelia Simonson|last matron]] rules [[The Kingdom of Prosper]], and this clan has become all but defunct in the politics of the "true" Blood-Clans.

#### Wakquk Clan
The [[Wakquk Twins]] have split their mother's claim into two; the [[Hurraquk Clan]] and the [[Garqwak Clan]]. Many consider this to be a petty disagreement between siblings gone too far - though those without their rule are happy to see disruption in their structures of power. 

#### [[Emorin Clan]]
A bureaucracy based community of permanent communities that feed large merchant bands. Many consider the Emorin to be the wisest of the Blood-Clans, as well as the most sharp-tongued.

#### [[Scrivin Clan]]
A elder-patriarchy of fierce militants. Many bands of the [[Scrivin Clan]] make Soul-contracts for magical powers with powerful entities. Other Blood-Clans unite against the Clan Scrivin often, as it is in everyone's best interest that they stay in a position of low power.

#### [[Bulgpim Clan]]
A caste clan of permanent farming communities. Few people find communication with members of the Bulgpim clan fruitful, as they speak a powerfully distant dialect of Goblin to eachother. Few high-caste members of this clan speak a common language (usually [[Arthurian (language)]]) for the purposes of facilitating trade and festivity.

#### [[Wheernat Clan]]
A socialist clan of pseudo-nomadic hunter-gatherers. The people of the Wheernat clan are taught to move with swiftness and grace, as well as to maintain a focus on your immediate community before the community of the others. It is a rarity to meet with a member of the clan who would be caught speaking with you. 

## Culture
#### Heritage
The Blood-clans are composed mostly of goblins and humans. There were many Hobgoblin families who were dissatisfied with the coming of the new peoples of Alaturmen and formed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] as an escape from the rule of the [[Bandit Lords]].

After their immediate opposition fell, they turned toward the freshborn [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]. The Clans were not organized enough nor well-equipped enough to push Arthur's forces beyond the borders of the [[Illburn Forest]]. With individual Sikgugu betraying one another on the field of battle in the name of their Clan and themselves or otherwise facing the overwhelming technological advantages of the King's mages and artificers, there was little hope for even as unified a front as the *other* Clans could muster.

And so, as [[Arthur Simonson|Artie]]'s kingdom failed to fall low to the Clans, they turned on one another as they have done so many times before. 

#### Language
Most people in these territories speak both [[Astral Goblin (language)]] and [[Arthurian (language)]].

#### Belief
The people who live in this place bind themselves and their clan mates to the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]]. Each of the clans have a unique perspective and interpretation of this document, which presents itself as a fairly unique spread of cultures.
