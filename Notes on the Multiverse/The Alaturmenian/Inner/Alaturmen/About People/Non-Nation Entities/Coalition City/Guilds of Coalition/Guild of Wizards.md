# Guild of Wizards
## History
The Guild of Wizards is responsible for the responsible use of Weave Arcane by the citizens of Alaturmen, as well as recording the history of our world and (in)validating legends or other creative works. 

For a list of High Power Wizards (including those not on the Council of Mages) see [[Loose Wizard NPCs]].

## Governance

### Council of Mages
The Council of Mages are the few people responsible for the use of Weave Arcane on Alaturmen. Each is titled the Mage of their domain.

The Red Mage, [[Alergra Barrowinch]]; Evocation / Enchantment
	(Speaks in my "normal" speaking voice, affected as annoyed, smart, & willing to learn something new)
The Blue Mage, [[The Wizard In Blue]]; Divination
	(Speaks in my normal speaking voice, as is.)
The Yellow Mage, [[Nicolas Talaveem]]; Illusion / Conjuration
	(Speaks in a mid-slow & exaggerated affect, light voice)
The White Mage, [[Pirre Tald]]; Abjuration
	(Speaks in a mid-high soft femme voice, highborn noble affect)
The Black Mage, [[Qiell Tilemundon]]; Necromancy
	(Speaks in my "normal" speaking voice, affected as ~a dark wizard~)

### Luh'turiñgolë Courier Service
The elvish word in the title of the Guild's courier service translates roughly to "a magical horse with magics and wisdom". It is the task of the Luh'turingole to transport information and objects throughout Alaturmen as authorized by the [[Guilds of Coalition]] at their discretion and necessity.

##### Turing Communication Tides
Waywalket Turing provided the Guild of Wizards with a large section of research regarding the field of communication. The most important finding was the 'Tide Effect' of divination-communication, such as performed even by minor mages. The 'Tide Effect' describes the phenomena occurring in the local area of the Weave when divination-communication is invoked; a ripple of interruption can occur when a practitioner does not specifically protect from the 'Tide Effect', which can lead to communication losses when a significant number of divination-communications occur in a local area, such as a communication center. 

The Guild of Wizards has constructed Luh'turiñgolë Towers in many areas of the world to expand the range of these protected divination-communications.
