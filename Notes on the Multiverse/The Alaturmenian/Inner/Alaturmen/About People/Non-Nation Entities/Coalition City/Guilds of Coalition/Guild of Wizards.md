# Guild of Wizards
## History
The Guild of Wizards is responsible for the responsible use of Weave Arcane by the citizens of Alaturmen, as well as recording the history of our world and (in)validating legends or other creative works. 

For a list of High Power Wizards (including those not on the Council of Mages) see [[Loose Wizard NPCs]].

## Governance

### Council of Mages
The Council of Mages are the few people responsible for the use of Weave Arcane on Alaturmen. Each is titled the Mage of their domain.

The Red Mage, [[Alergra Barrowinch]]; Evocation / Enchantment
	(Speaks in my "normal" speaking voice, affected as annoyed, smart, & willing to learn something new)
The Blue Mage, [[The Wizard In Blue]]; Divination
	(Speaks in my normal speaking voice, as is.)
The Yellow Mage, [[Nicolas Talaveem]]; Illusion / Conjuration
	(Speaks in a mid-slow & exaggerated affect, light voice)
The White Mage, [[Pirre Tald]]; Abjuration
	(Speaks in a mid-high soft femme voice, highborn noble affect)
The Black Mage, [[Qiell Tilemundon]]; Necromancy
	(Speaks in my "normal" speaking voice, affected as ~a dark wizard~)

### Luh'turiñgolë Courier Service
The elvish word in the title of the Guild's courier service translates roughly to "a magical horse with magics and wisdom". It is the task of the Luh'turingole to transport information and objects throughout Alaturmen as authorized by the [[Guilds of Coalition]] at their discretion and necessity.
