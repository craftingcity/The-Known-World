# Druids of Animan
## History
The Druids of Animan are a group of ancient ass druids who learned magic from the Idol Animan and taught it to a select few.

The Druids of Animan began to learn Arcane magic near the beginning of known Time on Alaturmen by working alongside and for the Idol Animan, who taught these mortals the poorly kept secrets of their siblings.

After these Druids had Mastered their crafts, they split, and formed additional Circles in revrance to the other Idols, who, when asked, gladly shared their tricks and tips. 

In exchange the Idols asked that this Weave Arcane never be abused, but they were *really* unclear about how they defined that. The Druids of Animan took it to mean that those they taught would need to learn a healthy respect for the magic.

At the time of the Guild of Wizard's formation, the Druids of Animan began to plan their betrayal of the Idols in pursuit of the greater secrets of arcane magic in conjunction with the "newest circle of druids", the Guild of Wizards.
