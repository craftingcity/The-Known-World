## Boundaries
Alaturmen is bound by the [[Wildlands]]. It forms a rough rectangle of "accessible" area for the people of this land - those that cross this invisible boundary enter the [[Wildlands]] never to be seen again.

## Contents
Alaturmen is some thirty-six thousand square miles. Here are the highlights;

There are four large [[Nations]] in the world who are all bound together in "Coalition", a federation of these four nations and a supported central governing body known as the [[Guilds of Coalition]]. This central body holds the largest settlement in Alaturmen, on the east end of the [[Deakred Range]]; [[Coalition City]].
