> This thick book is bound in red leather and brown strappings. Its pages are worn and yellowed. It looks perhaps a hundred years of age. On its face, a metal lock binds the book shut.

This is the Journal of [[Arthur Simonson]], King of [[The Kingdom of Prosper|Prosper]]. Its entries begin in the first century, and detail some of the forever young king's exploits. 

The journal begins with a small entry:

"To Whom It May Concern,
Welcome. You are reading now my recorded thoughts. I may spare no detail - this is your fair warning."

And then, it begins:

The first pages begin in the earliest years of time, when Arthur was a young man. They detail his life growing up as a half-hobgoblin who had no father to care for him. The next some become present, and they detail an adventurous life. 

For many years, this was Arthur's work; he went from place to place asking for work of any manner. Some jobs were quite successful. These entries sound of a man who has nothing but joy for the world. Throughout these entries, he extrapolates on the benefits of a life of adventure. Tales of jobs, friends, love, and riches. Some jobs were not successful. These entries sound of a man who has seen horror. War. Plague. Corruption. Death. Many fair warnings to never pursue this life.

All throughout these pages on adventures he has made, he makes remarks of the leadership; how it rules from fear and power rather than righteousness.

Then, some pages of madness. Undated ramblings, scribbled drawings, and torn pages. 

On the next entry, dated sometime in the [[Timeline|winter of the year 056AF]], he speaks of his Final Quest: to unite the lands under a time of prosperity that would last for as long as he lived. He speaks somewhat differently than before, using some less than transparent metaphor and many more nothing-words.

Then, he made war. His entries write of his close friends becoming generals in his war against the [[Bandit Lords]] that had taken a hold in the midst of the peoples of the Northwest.

"... and they said the Hobgoblins were making war. I have given orders to my legion to spread from [[Castle Prosper|Keep Prosper]] to defend our smaller holdings, but I cannot make the hobgoblin's peace. I have sent word to the [[Guild of Adventurers]], but for now I must keep our people safe."
