I am a thief. This means that I will...
Respect my fellows.
I fight for my own, and for our families.
They shall eat before we shall eat.
They shall heal before we shall heal.
Respect my marks.
I will not kill.
No life is worth less than any coin.
Especially my own. I will call my hits.
Respect my tools.
My tools are my livelihood.
There is no thing that will separate our bond.
