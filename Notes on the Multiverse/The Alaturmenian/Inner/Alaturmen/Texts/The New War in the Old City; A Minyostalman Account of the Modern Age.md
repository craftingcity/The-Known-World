## The Old City
### Getting In
```
	The Old City is an ancient and dangerous place that the authorities in the Church have attempted to Blockade and Exclude the area from the public. While the blockade is useful, preventing civilians from accidentially entering the area, it is not perfectly effective against the prepared. 

	The walls are inconsistently manned by members of the Church of the White Flame, and there are significant breaks and openings in the Northern, Eastern, and Southern walls, and there is a well-maintained gate in the Western wall.
```
### Working Here
```
	The lifestyle of those who work in Minyostalma is brutal. Your daily routine will include performing duties for your organizer, maintaining your health and equipment, and fighting for your lives.

	You will find yourself eating food that has traveled the width of the world before resting in your hands. You will encounter nightmare-beasts in familiar forms. You will begin to know someone, and you will see them ripped to shreds before your eyes.
```
### Getting Out
```
	Once you have finished in this place, you will find that exiting Minyostalma is more difficult than entering it. First and foremost, there is an express socio-economic jealousy in the people that can and does become violent. The down-on-their-luck will abandon any morality that remains within themselves and attempt to pry your 'ticket out' from your dying grasp.
```
### Disconnection
```
	I would be perfoming a disservice if I failed to mention the effects of being here, especially for the theocratically inclined. As you pass the Wall, you are entering another world - disconnected from the one you knew.

	In this world, our Gods cannot hear us. The Idols have no power here, nor the Ancients of beyond. In a conversation of our experience, a comrade of mine with experience in the subject described this disconnection; "I know that I am not lost. I feel [it], [it] knows I have not strayed. I am not alone, but I am not with my savior, my patron, my lord. [It] gave me gifts, before. Like [it], my gifts are not gone, but I cannot have them."

	In a similar vein of thought, the arcanists too are disconnected - less so than our theocratics. Again, I am not an expert on the subject, but my witnessed experience leads me to believe that those of you who understand the Weave will not be able to harness it as you did before. Often I saw catastrophic, destructive, unexpected results, and even for the most capable casters, the manipulation would cost them physically.

	Finally, I must warn you of the Call. There is something here, likely within the Temple district, and *it* is the voice in your head, not your God. It will tempt and promise and lie. Do not heed the Call.
```
## Organized People
### They Do Not Care
```
	Few organizations acting within The Old City do so with empathy. Most of the people here care only for themselves. Their money, their health, their glory. This place is ruled by the laws of Power. If you cannot defend it, it is not yours. Empathy is abused as a tool of Power. 

	As you are defenseless to your closest allies, they may become your strongest enemies.
```
### Gangs v. Groups
```
	The people who act alone in this City are the first to fall. You need someone to watch your back here. Come with a Gang you trust. Never betray them, never scorn them, because you need them.

	The individual coalition of your Gang is important, but having a Group to watch your back is even better. There are settlements in this place, where like-minded scavs gather together and form grander organizations. The Rookies, for example, occupy the village area near the northern entrance, and are supplied and managed by a man named Ondo, who lives within that village. Friends of Ondo are friends to eachother.
```
## Anomalies & Artifacts
### Radiation
```
	One of the hazards of this place is known as 'radiation'. 'Radiation' is an invisible poison. It is in the air here, and in the things we touch and hold. It becomes stronger and more dangerous as you go closer towards the city center. The taste of metal in your mouth and the ache in your head are signs that you are experiencing significant 'radioactivity'.
	
	Without protection, ideally in the form of a Hazardous Environment Facial Protector, you will become sick and weak, too weak even to save yourself. If you are sick, it is likely already too late, the poison is inside you and it will eventually kill you. 
```
### Anomalies
```
	Another of the hazards in this special City come in the form of 'anomalies'. I must again state that this is not my area of expertise, but I do have an understanding of them. 'Anomalies' are spaces within the Exclusion District where the typical rules of our reality are bent or broken. This might look like solid air, or liquid fire, or boiling soil, or any number of other oddities. The two consistencies regarding 'Anomalies' are their danger, and their Artifacts.
```
### Artifacts
```
	Artifacts are the money maker, the real reason to come here. In these pockets of unreality we call 'anomalies', Artifacts form. In congruency with the uncertainty of these 'anomalies', their Artifacts hold unknown proporties, or I should say, hold proporties unknown to most. You may know legends or tales that describe a magical gem or stone that can heal any wound, or throw off any assailent, or create more heat than any fire. These very likely are Artifacts that have come from Minyostalma.
```
## Preparation & Maintenance
### Arms
```
	In the City, the people fight differently than you may be used to. Sword and sorcery rule combats outside the walls, but the bow and the bullet rule here. I recommend familiarizing yourself with a ranged weapon, more ranged than your spear or halberd, and bring more ammunition than you think you will ever need - you will need more than that much here.
```
### Armors
```
	The armoring of the people who fight in the City is typical, leather, chitin, and steel are all viable here still, but there is other armoring here too - alchemical armors built specifically to survive here.
```
### Provisions
```
	Food and Water fuel you and your expeditions. In addition to ammunition and medical supplies, sustinence will be a major cost for you. You can hunt here, at your own risk. The animals here fight back. Water is present, but generally will need to be prepared before you can drink it - filter out any dirt or scum, then boil it before you drink any water you collect here, even rain. 
```
### Specialties
```
	People have been working in the City for a long time. Long enough for technology to catch up to the dangers the City presents;
	
	'Radiation' can be detected by a small device known as the 'Tuned Hazardous Location Alert System' (a THLAS), which is vital to long-term survival. 

	'Anomalies' can be visible to the naked eye, but most are not. The assurance that a 'Extreme Weave Distortion Detector' provides is equally vital to that of the THLAS, allowing you to avoid the other invisible danger of this City.

	Artifacts typically are visible to the naked eye, and can be collected with no special equipment. This is foolish, but possible. Artifacts can be detected in a similar manner to 'Anomalies', by using a specialized device, allowing you to notice invisible or hidden Artifacts with a given area. In addition, most Artifacts should be stored in lead-lined containers or otherwise specialized storage units.
