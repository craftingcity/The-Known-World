## The Old City
### Getting In
```
	The Old City is an ancient and dangerous place that the authorities in the Church have attempted to Blockade and Exclude the area from the public. While the blockade is useful, preventing civilians from accidentially entering the area, it is not perfectly effective against the prepared. 

	The walls are inconsistently manned by members of the Church of the White Flame, and there are significant breaks and openings in the Northern, Eastern, and Southern walls, and there is a well-maintained gate in the Western wall.
```
### Working Here
```
	The lifestyle of those who work in Minyostalma is brutal. Your daily routine will include performing duties for your organizer, maintaining your health and equipment, and fighting for your lives.

	You will find yourself eating food that has traveled the width of the world before resting in your hands. You will encounter nightmare-beasts in familiar forms. You will begin to know someone, and you will see them ripped to shreds before your eyes.
```
### Getting Out
```
	Once you have finished in this place, you will find that exiting Minyostalma is more difficult than entering it. First and foremost, there is an express socio-economic jealousy in the people that can and does become violent. The down-on-their-luck will abandon any morality that remains within themselves and attempt to pry your 'ticket out' from your dying grasp.
```
### Disconnection
```
	I would be perfoming a disservice if I failed to mention the effects of being here, especially for the theocratically inclined. As you pass the Wall, you are entering another world - disconnected from the one you knew.

	In this world, our Gods cannot hear us. The Idols have no power here, nor the Ancients of beyond. In a conversation of our experience, a comrade of mine with experience in the subject described this disconnection; "I know that I am not lost. I feel [it], [it] knows I have not strayed. I am not alone, but I am not with my savior, my patron, my lord. [It] gave me gifts, before. Like [it], my gifts are not gone, but I cannot have them."

	In a similar vein of thought, the arcanists too are disconnected - less so than our theocratics. Again, I am not an expert on the subject, but my witnessed experience leads me to believe that those of you who understand the Weave will not be able to harness it as you did before. Often I saw catastrophic, destructive, unexpected results, and even for the most capable casters, the manipulation would cost them physically.

	Finally, I must warn you of the Call. There is something here, likely within the Temple district, and *it* is the voice in your head, not your God. It will tempt and promise and lie. Do not heed the Call.
```
## Organized People
### They Do Not Care
```
	Few organizations acting within The Old City do so with empathy. Most of the people here care only for themselves. Their money, their health, their glory. This place is ruled by the laws of Power. If you cannot defend it, it is not yours. Empathy is abused as a tool of Power. 

	As you are defenseless to your closest allies, they may become your strongest enemies.
```
### Gangs v. Groups
```
	The people who act alone in this City are the first to fall. You need someone to watch your back here. Come with a Gang you trust. Never betray them, never scorn them, because you need them.

	The individual coalition of your Gang is important, but having a Group to watch your back is even better. There are settlements in this place, where like-minded scavs gather together and form grander organizations. The Rookies, for example, occupy the village area near the northern entrance. The Rookies are supplied and managed by a man named Ondo.
