## The Old City
### Getting In
```
	The Old City is an ancient and dangerous place that the authorities in the Church have attempted to Blockade and Exclude the area from the public. While the blockade is useful, preventing civilians from accidentially entering the area, it is not perfectly effective against the prepared. 

	The walls are inconsistently manned by members of the Church of the White Flame, and there are significant breaks and openings in the Northern, Eastern, and Southern walls, and there is a well-maintained gate in the Western wall.
```
### Working Here
```
	The lifestyle of those who work in Minyostalma is brutal. Your daily routine will include performing duties for your organizer, maintaining your health and equipment, and fighting for your lives.

	You will find yourself eating food that has traveled the width of the world before resting in your hands. You will encounter nightmare-beasts in familiar forms. You will begin to know someone, and you will see them ripped to shreds before your eyes.
```
### Getting Out
```
	Once you have finished in this place, you will find that exiting Minyostalma is more difficult than entering it. First and foremost, there is an express socio-economic jealousy in the people that can become violent. The down-on-their-luck will abandon any morality that remains within themselves and attempt to pry your 'ticket out' from your dying grasp.
```
### Disconnection
```
	I would be perfoming a disservice if I failed to mention the effects of being here, especially for the theocratically inclined. As you pass the Wall, you are entering another world - disconnected from the one you knew.

	In this world, our Gods cannot hear us. The Idols have no power here, nor the Ancients of beyond. In a conversation of our experience, a comrade described this disconnection; "I know that I"
