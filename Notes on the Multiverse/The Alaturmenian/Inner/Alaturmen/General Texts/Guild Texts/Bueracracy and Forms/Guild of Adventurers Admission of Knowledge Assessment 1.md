# GAAKA One
### Guild of Adventurers Admission of Knowledge Assessment
The GAAKA is an assessment designed to determine your knowledge of relevant topics of information, your ability to coherently recall that information. Over the course of the next hour, you will answer questions by selecting one of a number of given options or providing a short written answer when prompted. 

You are taking the GAAKA One, which will focus primarily on the important historical events and people of the late first century. There are a total of 35 questions, of which you will provide a written answer for 15. The final five questions are considered 'extra credit', and thus your proctor will not penalize you for an incorrect answer or a lack of answer for these questions. They are clearly marked as such.
