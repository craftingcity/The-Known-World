Nearly two weeks to the day of the publishing article, our Coalition was rocked by a force of Arcani that has become known as the Hum. Many of you witnessed this event, and in an attempt to quell fear in those of you who did not, we took deliberate time in forming our response - for our lack of haste, we are sorry.

It was thought that the force in question first came to us even before these two weeks ago. Our Wizards tell me that this is false. In fact this force has been seen before, in a terrifyingly similar capacity, twenty-six years ago. 

Those of us who know the tales of [[The Grey Ordeal]] can speak upon the distraught of the 89th year; though many of us may know them know as friends and family, the Gnoll first came to Alaturmen then, with their hunger burning in their pit, as warbands fighting side-by-side with horrors unseen. Their arrival was known throughout our Coalition by the alert of our Bards - and more relevantly, the Hum Arcani they heard or produced.

Rangers were able to save many settlements, but many of your homes did fall - to warbands or insurrectionists alike. Our Wizards and our Adventurers, most notably and namely [[The Grey Ordeal]], were able to quell the most major threat, but not without loss. My use of quell is specific and intentional. This major threat is not gone, and in fact stands at the door to our home once again. The Guilds need you. I spoke with the Yellow Mage, [[Nicolas Talaveem]], and I asked what he would say to the common citizen;

"I would request that we do not falter. That we stay strong, that our Coalition stays strong. We have been silent in our contemplation, but we now must act - as one. We do not name our enemy for its utterance is an invitation into its grasp. You may have seen actions performed by groups of peoples that we, as citizens, must take great care in placing blame upon. Know that it was the individual and the circumstance, not the peoples, that caused these great harms to our communities.

Know that the Council of Mages and the Guild of Wizards as a whole is working diligently with the Guilds of Adventurers and Rangers, as well as your local governance, to maneuver our defenses towards our great enemy. You may see more Guilded passing through or seeking refuge within your holdings. Know that these actors are here for your safety, and please, perform any reasonable task they ask of you within the best of your abilities. 

To those among you who can perform crafts of Weave Arcane - I urge you to take great care in your continued exploration of any unknown fields. The most clear evidence linking each of the attacks is the work of the unprepared caster, the one who attempts to reach beyond their limits. By no means is this statement a formal declaration or ruling on the practices of magic, but rather advice that comes from multiple peers with vast resources."
