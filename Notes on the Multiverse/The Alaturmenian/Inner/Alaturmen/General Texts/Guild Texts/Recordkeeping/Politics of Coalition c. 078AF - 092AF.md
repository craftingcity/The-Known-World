### 078AF

In the 78th year, the Coalition was formed, and my place as recordkeeper was created. It is our goal to unite the people of this land we call our home under one governance, with the effect of growth and prosperity. It is my duty to further that goal as much as I can, and I find myself in the position to do so by reminding us of what has come before.

As the direct-selected choice of [[Waywalket Turring]], I clearly find myself positioned to come from a place of bias, but know that I will do my best to outperform.
