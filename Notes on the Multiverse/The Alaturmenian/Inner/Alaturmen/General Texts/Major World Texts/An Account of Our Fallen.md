## An account of Our Fallen
#### by [[River Powell]]

> The text is a collection of names supposed to have lived in [[The Old|Minyostalma]] before the [[Great Fires]]. There is little to no personal notation throughout the text other than in the foreword;

I was there when the sky opened. It burnt our eyes. I can only see the faces of the dead now. I cannot stop hearing their names.

> The text is split into three chapters; Accounted, Unaccounted, and Survived.
> The chapter titled Accounted lists several hundred names, (exactly 764 in total) each of which is followed by the words "accounted by" and a second name. Each of these second names are found as well in the Survived chapter.
> The chapter titled Unaccounted lists several thousand names (exactly 24,331 in total).
> The chapter titled Survived lists roughly two hundred names, (exactly 193 in total) most of which are followed by a brief description of where they found refuge during the [[Great Fires]], typically underground or outside of [[Its Greatness]]' area of effect.
