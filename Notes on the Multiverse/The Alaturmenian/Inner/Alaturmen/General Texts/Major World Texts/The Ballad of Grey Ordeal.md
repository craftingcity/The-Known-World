# The Ballad of Grey Ordeal
### Original Oration by [[Paulo San Tymiq]]
#### Written by [[Poppy Bumbleheart]]

## They were all young when they met. 

A bar, so the public says, but I don't believe them. 

Waywalket was the first to introduce herself; "a student of the arcane and otherwise"

Eladrithal thought this funny, but during their time together quickly found himself respecting her words.

Tubric, ever the gentleman, was second. He spoke in a voice that was short but he spoke in sentences long. Many words, all of them fruitful, efficient, bulbous, and insightful. 

The talks these three would have over a bottle of spirit; Tubric would always be able to find the center of their words.

Uncomfortably, the elf spoke third. To the others, it was clear he came from a place not here; his features gave that much away, if not for the stench of the forest, clear air on his skin.

He told them his story.
That he was not from here.
That he was alive before this.
That he once had another home.


He asked for help.
That he would go against their wishes.
That he would find a way back home.
That he would see his parents again.

The others agreed. Emphatic. Empathetic?

But they needed cash. Nothing moves without cash, especially the bones of the world.

So they asked the Old Man.

He was happy to oblige; a favor he needed; in exchange - the great treasure of desire.

Done and done - "What would you have us do?"

Some days travel. 

## A long walk.

Eladrithal Greystone.

Was walking ahead. Just too far.

His legs.

So long.

His new friends looked up at him; trundling ahead.

"Branches." 

"Hard rope."

"Stop that."

Through laughter; "She started it!"

The gnome and dwarf jolly lagged behind.

A rock, the back of the blonde head stained red with blood and his face with dust; too far.

"FUCK"

"GRAX YUR WZHIMLUAX BEYGU'UOK"

A goblin rogue.

A kind people, situationally quite distressed.

Desperate times, I say.

The two rush forward, and Eladrithal tries to stand, his head is hit again with the rock, he is unconscious, bleeding out the back of his head. The goblin, I never learned his name, goes for his pack. 

Roots around.

Pulls out some bread, confused with its paper wrapping;

Flare to the face! - Turring is a good shot, she always has been.

With just the two of them, they scare off the rouge.

What of Eladrithal, you say, his story cant end this early; it doesn't, worry not you beautiful soul; but how?

## Tubric Millstone Wrinsmith.

Grew up in a place we call Mountain Hall. The Wrinsmiths are famous now, no thanks to Tubric. 

As a lad, he worked with his mother, in the church, and worshiped Blemon alongside his peers.

The god chose him. A long time ago. 

Blemon raised the boy, but he made himself the man.

With a dull green light, Tubric waves his amulet over the head of his fallen friend. A moment passes, and he says a few words we would not understand; too powerful for our ears - not godspeech, as I have been corrected, but some measure of Weave; near all the same to me.

As he layed there, pitched in dirt, he dreamed.

He thinks this an unpleasant sensation, bless the elves, and wakes himself as soon as he is able.

## They rested under the trees.

They made a small camp, kept themselves small and quiet, they knew they were not made safe in this forest.

But they had to rest.

Waywalket spoke of her home - "I realize I haven't shared".

She grew up in a small village. She spent her early years working with her family at their home.

She knew she was destined to learn more.

She left. And began to practice.

"And now I can do this!"

A small display - she knew where they were.

But great potential.

Eladrithal knew he chose wisely. As did Tubric. As did Waywalket.

## On the second day.

There was a big rock. Long and tall, spindled with encorement - the [[Stone of Desmoniur]].
