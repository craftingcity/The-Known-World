The Texts Druidic are a collection of resources created and maintained by the [[Circles of Idols]] that describe the philosophies, abilities, and histories of each of the five circles of the individual idols. This massive tome of lore is the basis of Modern Wizardry, as the axioms and many of the theories of the Weave Arcane are first published *in* this work.

The [[Circle of Animan]] is responsible for the publicization of this work, much to the chagrin of the other Circles.
