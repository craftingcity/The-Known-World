#### Squirrel
#### Bear
### The Monsters...
#### The Cancer
> *'To an undiscerning eye, the Cancer looks to be simply an obese hog, but this is not the case. The Cancer's squat and portly seeming legs expand to sharp long claws, the juicy pork of the beast is marked with boils and tumors, and its stout face is clipped back to a gross dripping maw.'*

#### The Demon
> '*A horrible black beast lurks the Grey Forest. Survivor's rumors claim its hide is impenetrable, and it's claws and teeth sharper than any blade. It is unkillable, impossible to track, and it will kill you and your party before you've noticed it's there.*'

```

```

#### The Freak
> '*This creature was clearly once a humanoid. It wears a mask and clothing appropriate for the dangers of Minyostalma, but it has clearly changed. Crawling on all fours, mouth agape below its mask, the Freak is a horrible sight.*'

```

#### The Hidden Man
> '*Rumors of small stout men with telekinetic abilities litter the journals of dead scavs, some as silly as men dying to flung tins of beans, but few believe that these creatures exist. They do, and flying foods is the least of a Scavs concerns.*'

```
Small Humanoid;
16 AC, 124 HP, +4 prof
25ft walk
Psycic Shield, reaction (d6 recharge, 3-6) - When the Hidden Man is the target of a ranged attack, he will spend his reaction to project a shield that absorbs projectiles, and lasts until the end of his next turn. As an action on that turn, he can reflect the collected projectiles.

```
Large Monstrosity;
20ft walk
11 AC, 228 HP, DR 3, +2 prof

Grab - The Mass reaches for an adjacent creature, and makes a contested Althetics Check (+11). If the creature fails, it is Grappled by the Mass.
```

#### The Warper
> '*We think it was once a man. It looks the part. The elongated limbs, sharp claws for fingers, bloody tendrils for a mouth, and above all else the camouflage this monster uses makes that theory less than likely. Or one hell of a man to start.*'

17 AC, 96 HP, +3 prof
35ft walk
