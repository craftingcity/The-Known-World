## Things Aren't Right Here...
### Casting
#### Divine & Natural Spellcasters
While many of the most common spellcasters draw on divine or natural powers, those casters will find that their powers have been stripped from them in this place. While you may call upon a natural or divine power in this place, you are sure to fail to reach them. Repeated attempts may draw upon the ire of the Old...

	> When a "divine" or "natural" caster attempts to cast a spell, they may expend a number of hit-die equal to the spell's level. If they do not, they take that number of d10 psycic damage instead. This effect only occurs after a caster's first spell or after 4 hours in The Old.
	> After this point, spell slots may not be expended and spells may not be cast - including cantrips.
	> The following dnd5e spellcaster classes are effected; Druids, Rangers, Clerics, Paladins, Warlocks.

#### Arcane Spellcasters
Where their Divine companions are personally punished for their casting, and may be unable to safely cast spells at all, Arcane spellcasters are often overwhelmed with the effectiveness of their spells while they are cast within the Old.

	> When a "arcane" caster attempts to cast a spell, they make a Arcana check equal to five plus the value of the spell slot spent times five. 
	> 	If they succeed, they take a number of d6 psycic damage equal to the spell's level, and the spell is cast as per usual. 
	> 	If they fail, they take a number of 1d12 psycic damage equal to the spell's level, and then spell's effective level is doubled (as if it was cast with a spell slot twice the value of the spent slot). Then, they roll on the Hazardous Wild Magic table, unless you are casting a Cantrip, in which case they roll on the Normal Wild Magic table.
	> The following dnd5e spellcaster classes are efffected; Artificer, Bard, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster, Sorcerer, Wizard

### Hazards
#### Anomalies
Areas within the Old are subject to dense knots in the Weave that manifest as an area of powerful magical disruption. The Scavengers of the area have taken to calling these places Anomalies or Anomalous Fields, depending on their understanding of what is actually creating the aforementioned knot.

To notice a hidden Anomaly or an Anomalous Field, a creature may simply view it on a DC 19 Survival check of the area. Otherwise, a creature may attempt to activate anomalies they cannot see. This is typically done by throwing a piece of rubbish along a path, walking that path, and continuing until opposed by the anomaly, at which point one would maneuver around it, when able.

Anomalies do not have charges, in an arcane sense, and can be reactivated immediately. Anomalies are activated by a material (organic or otherwise) disturbing them. Staying within an active anomaly *will* result in severe damage, if not death.

#### Burner (V)
###### Fire 
> A burner anomaly is like vents of fire you cannot see until you have stepped over them. The fire will come as quick as it will go, and before you can call their name, your comrade will be ash.

The field of burners is a 10' radius circle. Within this radius, each 5' square has a 1/6 chance of being an activatable space within the field. When one of these spaces is activated, it creates a column of fire 5' tall. This column deals 4d8 fire damage to a creature that occupies it, and 1d8 fire damage to a creature within 5' of it.

#### Comet / Electro (V)
###### Fire / Electric
> A comet anomaly is like a ball of fire, moving with the speed of a rolling boulder. While you may think you can dodge it, do your math again. Can you dodge it from behind, and then once more? Artyom could not.

A comet anomaly is a 10' sphere of flame that can occupy any point on a path within a 35' radius sphere. The comet has an Initiative of 15, and will move along this path at a speed of 25' per round. During this time, any creature on the comet's path must make a DC 17 Dexterity Saving Throw. Those creatures take 4d6 fire / lightning damage on a failure, and half that amount on a success.

If a creature enters a space within 5' of the comet anomaly or ends their turn there, they take 4d6 fire / lightning damage.

#### Vortex (H)
###### Force
> A vortex anomaly is like a powerful wind that will pick you up off your feet and spin you until you begin to separate at the joints. If you somehow keep your limbs, you had better land on your feet. 

The field of vortexes is a 15' radius circle. Within this radius, each 5' square has a 1/8 chance of being an activatable space within the field. When one of these spaces is activated, it creates a gripping wind in a 15' tall cone that has a base diameter of 15', centered on the activated space. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a DC 17 Strength Saving Throw or take 3d12 bludgeoning damage and be flung 10' from the tip of the cone in a random direction.

#### Springboard (H)
###### Force
> A springboard anomaly is like a blade of air - if you are lucky, and hit by the flat end, you may fly into the air, if you are not, and hit the sharp end, you will be two parts of a whole corpse.

The springboard anomaly is a 10' diameter circle. When the springboard is activated, creatures within the circle must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity Saving Throw, or be pushed 5' in a random direction. If they fail by 5 or more, they additionally take 4d10 slashing damage.

#### Fruit Punch (V)
###### Acid
> A fruit punch anomaly is like an overflowing bowl of boiling water - a burn is common, and a death is a horrible sight. White-hot acid is no toy.

The field of fruit punches is a 15' radius circle. Within this radius, each 5' square has a 1/6 chance of being active for up to 3d6 rounds. While active, creatures who enter the active space or begin their turn there take 3d6 acid damage. 

#### Burnt Fuzz (V)
###### Electric
> A fuzzball, or a burnt fuzz, whatever you want to call it, is only really a rookie killer. Just don't run. Walk real slow, and you should be fine. Ivan is the worst case I've seen, and he only has burn scars up to his torso and a wicked trigger twitch.

The burnt fuzz anomaly is a 15' radius circle of copper-green spindly vines. When a creature moves more than 5' in a round through the circle, they take 1d6 lightning damage for each 5' space moved.

#### Gas Cloud (V)
###### Acid
> A gas cloud anomaly is aptly named - green clouds of toxic gas boil the skin off your muscles and then the muscles off your bones, not that you won't die of inhalation and internal bleeding first.

The field of gas cloud anomalies is a 25' radius circle. Within this radius, each 10' space has a 1/4 chance of being active for 3d6 hours. While active, a creature that begins their turn within the sphere takes 1d8 poison damage. For every turn they have spent in a gas cloud in this anomaly field, the damage increases by 1d8.

#### Electro (V)
###### Electric
> An Electro anomaly field is like a magicians trick. On the ground or the wall, you will see a crackling blue light, grasping out like a wicked weed. It will burn you, and worse if you're wearing metal.

The field of Electro anomalies is a 25' radius circle. Within this radius, each 5' space has a 1/6 chance of being active for 3d6 minutes. While active, a creature that begins their turn with 5' of the space takes 2d6 lightning damage. A creature that enters the active space takes 4d6 lightning damage.

#### Space (V)
###### Force
> A Space anomaly field is often hard to see. It is like the bubbles of soap, barely shimmering in the sun. It comes in many shapes and sizes, and it often blocks an obvious path. Ivan told me once on his trip into [[#The City]] that a Space field had cut into a portion of the building he was in, removing a whole room and a half.

The Space anomaly is described as a field, but it is a singular entity with an undefined shape and size. It is a solid but invisible force shape that simply exists where it is.

#### Teleport (V)
###### Force
> A Teleport anomaly is... strange. I have only heard rumors of it, and Artyom was always a big mouth. He said he saw a white smoke, swirling to a point in the air. He - like the dumbass he was, rest his soul - reached out with his hand to feel the smoke. Then he woke up by the south wall.

#### Emission (V)
###### NA
> An Emission is not like other anomalies. It is the Old fighting us. The sky will shudder, and the sun will boil. Hide. Even if your body survives the heat and winds, your brain will not. You will know no reason. Only hunger. It is a kindness to take a life like that.

Emissions occur above [[#The Temple]] and extends outward to the edges of the Old before ceasing. As the intensity of the large (minutes or hours long) wave of Emission increases, so do the effects. The Emission deals 1d4 psychic damage per round spent unroofed. If a creature falls unconscious while unroofed, they become something like the [[#Fallen]].

#### Radiation (H)
###### NA
> A Radiation anomaly field cannot be seen. It will kill you, slowly at first, but soon your brain will slow, and your blood will stop. Your organs will fail, and you will die a painful, rotting death. Protect yourself.

The Radiation anomaly is of undefined shape and size, but it is generally quite large - covering buildings more than singular rooms or objects. It is, however, attracted to metal over long periods of time, leading to contact with metal within the field being quite dangerous.

	Radiation is applied every round, at the beginning of a character's turn, and will accumulate over time. 
	
	When a character has more Radiation than the value of their Constitution Score, they take a number of radiant damage equal to the difference. Any Radiation that would be applied to a character is reduced by their current Radiation Protection.

	A number of Radiation is removed at the end of a character's turn equal to their Radiation Reduction plus their Constitution Modifier.

	Early signs of radiation poisoning include, in order of intensity...
		- dizzieness, headache
		- taste of metal, nausea, rough coughing
		- vomitting, stomach pains
		- high fever, decrease or loss of conciousness, red burns to exposed skin
		- vomitting blood
