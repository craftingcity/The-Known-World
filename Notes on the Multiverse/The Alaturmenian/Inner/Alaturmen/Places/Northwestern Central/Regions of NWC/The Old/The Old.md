### Present
Minyostalma is a collective name for the villages and townships that surround the most major city in the "Old Elven Empire" that never was. It has been cordoned off from the rest of [[The Holyl'nds]] with a large military presence - though most of the soldiers holding the line here are preventing people from leaving more than stopping people from coming in.

The Ruins to the west and north of the central city are the most picked over, as scavengers have frequented the area for dozens of years at this point. As you come closer and closer to the central Temple structure in the walled city-proper, the more dangerous the scavenging becomes, and even the most prepared scavengers do not spend long inside The Old.

### Background
The common name for The Old - Minyostalma - translates into 'the first city' or 'the important place', as it was to be both the most important and the first of many cities in the sweeping elven empire. This would never come to pass. When the first elves came to Alaturmen, those who came to make Minyostalma an honorable attempt at an empire came with made plans.
