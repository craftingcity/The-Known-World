### The People...
Many people who come and go from this place are peaceful folk who need money, and try their luck in the prosperous ruins of the old empire. The most unprepared are those that believe anyone they encounter is not willing to kill them for their findings.

##### Scavengers
A collective name for the individuals and groups without a greater affiliation to a faction without or within the Old. Most of these people came to find their fortune, and were miserably mistaken. They have likely tried and failed to escape this place, and have instead reluctantly gathered with others to survive in this place.


###### Equipment
The Scavs are very likely underequipped.

###### Areas of Operation
- [[The Places...#The Haven]]
	- The *Rookies* within the Haven are united by their allegiance to [[Ondo]] and each other. 
	- *Rookies* and *Extramis* fight against the *Militants* coming from [[The Places...#The Cordon]].
- [[The Places...#The Sticks]]
	- The Scavs within the Sticks leave with fewer friends than they entered with, and much more trauma.
	- *Rookies* fight against *Bandits* and *Militants* coming from [[The Places...#The Eastern Breach (1/rr)]] or the [[The Places...#Grey Forest (4/rr)]].
- [[The Places...#The Factory]] & [[The Places...#The Base]]
	- Most Scavs avoid this area for fear of *Bandits* or *Mercenaries*.
- [[The Places...#The City]] & [[The Places...#The Village]]
	- Few Scavs operate in the South, and those who do are allied to many different (and even conflicting) Factions.
- [[The Places...#The Shipyard]]
	- The *Talons* within the Shipyard are united by their allegiance to [[Zarchen]] and each other.
	- *Talons* and *Troopers* fight against *Fallen* coming from [[The Places...#The Temple]] or [[The Places...#Flats (6/rr)]].

###### Politics
- Other *Scavangers* can be shady, but the *Rookies* and *Talons* are good.
- *Militants* try to shoot us on sight. We fight back.
- *Mercenaries* are shady. They are worth dealing with.
- *Extramis* are the good guys. They help us, we help them.
- *Troopers* are shady. They usually try to fight us if we meet outside [[The Places...#The Shipyard]].

##### White-Flame Militants
[[The Church of the White Flame]] is - according to official Guild records - only maintaining a border presence to prevent any further entrance into these very dangerous and historic ruins. Anyone who has actually seen this place can tell you that is not true. Bands of well-equipped soldiers actively patrol the Old and more commonly attack on sight than arrest and eject "trespassers".

###### Equipment
The WFM are reasonably equipped for military containment, but undersupplied for deep exploration.

| Major       | (Blessed Platemail)  20 | +11    (x3) | 4d6+8 dam       (Dual-pop Carbine)    |

###### Areas of Operation
- [[The Places...#The Cordon]]
	- The *Militants* occupy and control the Cordon as a Command Headquarters for their extended operations.
	- The *Militants* fight against *Rookies* and *Extramis* for control of [[The Places...#The Haven]].
- [[The Places...#The Factory]] & [[The Places...#The Base]]
	- The *Militants* fight against *Bandits* and *Mercenaries* for control of the Industrial Section.
	- The additional presence of *Troopers*, *Extramis*, and/or *Fallen* makes this impossible, but not unprofitable.
- [[The Places...#The City]] & [[The Places...#The Village]]
	- The *Militants* fight against everyone in the south, and don't stay around for long.

###### Politics
- *Scavangers* are fugitives and heretics. They aren't worth the bullets, but we must.
- Other *Militants* are good kin. We're all trying to do our duty.
- *Mercenaries* are terrible. No better than Scavs, just harder to kill.
- *Extramis* doesn't exist. Those are Scavs.
- *Troopers* are terrible. No better than Scavs, just harder to kill.

##### Mercenaries
Hired soldiers willing to keep their employer's identity secret, the Mercenary groups within the Old are mysterious and fickle. While often reliable, when an opportunity presents itself, the Mercenaries have no issue betraying their otherwise well-earned trust for the benefit of their patrons.

| Solo Operator   | (D. Power Plate)   23, DR 5 | +10 (x3) | 4d6+10 dam (Dual-pop Carbine) |

###### Equipment
The Mercenaries are well-equipped.

###### Areas of Operation
- [[The Places...#The Factory]]
	- Home sweet home, Factory HQ.
	- Chokepoints help *Mercenaries* fight against *Militants*, *Scavs*, and *Troopers* to maintain control of the area.
	- Thankfully, *Fallen* don't come up this far.
- [[The Places...#The Base]]
	- The First Objective.
	- *Mercenaries* fight against against everyone necessary to perform operations here.
- [[The Places...#The City]] & [[The Places...#The Village]]
	- The Second Objective.
	- *Mercenaries* fight against everyone necessary to perform operations here.
	- We try to leave *Extramis* alone, but it's no issue if they try us.
- [[The Places...#The Temple]]
	- The Final Objective.
	- *Mercenaries* fight against everyone necessary to perform operations here.
- [[The Places...#The Shipyard]]
	- Sometimes, you need to buy more bullets. Sneak in, sneak out. *Troopers* don't like us sticking around too long.

###### Politics
- *Scavangers* are too inexperienced to survive here. May as well scam 'em first.
- *Militants* can be trouble, but we always need them gone.
- Other *Mercenaries* are good. We can all go home if we work together.
- *Extramis* are fine, they don't mess with us, so we don't mess with them.
- *Troopers* have a weird sense of honor. Sell you a gun only to hunt you with it's sister.

##### Extramis
Extramis is a loose collective of ex-soldiers and experienced seekers that claim to be members of [[Arthur's Knights]] with the common drive to liberate Minyostalma into the hands of the Arthurian people. While the validity of their claim to [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] is subject to question, their effectiveness within the Old is not.

###### Equipment
Extramis is underequipped, but knowledgeable.

##### Mountain Troopers
Equipped and ordered by the [[Nobles of Mountain Hall]], the Mountain Troopers are most identifiable by their thick shining metal armors and their well supplied durandurm blasters.

###### Equipment
The Mountain Troopers are well equipped. Typically, fresh Troopers sport Tank-Plate, a HEPF2, and a standard Carbine, but after time within the M.B.E.D., they will likely have modified their Carbine to the best of their ability, and the best of the best eventually sport their own Durandurm Powered Plate.

##### Fallen
Deep within the Walled ruins, there is some artifact that the White Flame was attempting to destroy when it came to this place so long ago. Those who travel too deep are said to rarely return, and when they do, they are not the same, raving about the *glorious flame* and it's *beautiful oblivion*. The only mercy for them is death. They are beyond reason. Resist them.

<The Fallen speak [[Ancient Elvish (language)]], and have access to an incredible arsenal.>

###### Equipment
The Fallen are more than well equipped, sporting heavily modded Durandurm Carbines or Machine Repeaters, powered armors, and an array of the finest ammunition, explosives, and artifacts in Minyostalma.
