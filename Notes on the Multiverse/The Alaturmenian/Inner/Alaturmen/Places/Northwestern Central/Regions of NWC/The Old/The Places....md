# The Places...
Each of the following locations describe the contents of the singular hex-mile they are contained within (excepting the City and Village, which are two and three hex-miles respectively, and are still described below). 

## The Cordon
#### The Western Entrance (1/rr)
The Western Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Western Entrance are exclusively to prevent unidentified persons from exiting the Old.

Entering this gate leads directly to the area within the Cordon known as the Reserve.

#### The Recreations Camp (1/rr)
The Recreation Camp is directly north of [[#The Reserve (1/rr)]]. The WFM in the area use the Recreations Camp to relieve the stress of operating within the Old.

Alongside physical recreation games, such as ringtoss or kickball, there are small cabins for warmth, table games, drug use, and sexual recreation.

#### The Killing Fields (1/rr)
The Killing Fields are directly north of [[#The Depot (1/rr)]]. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old. 

The name "Killing Fields" was given to this area of their perimeter due to the number of Scavs that attempt to breach the Cordon from the north.

#### The Mudhouse (2/rr)
Northeast of the Depot, a mudbrick outhouse stands out as a lone survivor amidst the desolation surrounding it. Surrounding the outhouse are the ruins of other abandoned structures, their walls crumbling, serving as eerie reminders of a home long lost.

#### The Reserve (1/rr)
A series of large tents and semi-permanent structures form a small military town. WFM use the Reserve and the surrounding areas as their primary base of operations within the Old.

Trails lead from the Reserve throughout the Cordon, connecting the dispirit settlements into one grander area.

#### The Depot (1/rr)
The largest and most-well protected area within the Cordon, the Depot is a warehouse used by the WFM as storage for their resources and equipment that is exclusively for WFM members only. It is located east of [[#The Reserve (1/rr)]], and west of [[#The Hunting Slots (2/rr)]].

#### The Hunting Slots (2/rr)
The Hunting Slots are directly east of [[#The Depot (1/rr)]]. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old. 

The name "Hunting Slots" was given to this area of their perimeter due to the number of natural mutant threats that attempt to breach the Cordon from the east. Much of the food supply the WFM eat comes from these mutants.

#### The Barracks (1/rr)
The sparse activity within the Reserve continues south into the Barracks. This area stands in stark contrast to [[#The Recreations Camp (1/rr)]] for it's somber air. Made of bare walls surely reinforced by layers of metal and mortar, the Barracks are used exclusively for sleep and the storage of personal accoutrement. 

#### The Training Grounds (1/rr)
South of [[#The Depot (1/rr)]] and East of [[#The Barracks (1/rr)]], the Training Grounds is an area filled with obstacles, shooting ranges, and combat simulations to hone and test the skills of both new recruits and veterans.

#### The Forward Post (2/rr)
South-east of [[#The Depot (1/rr)]], a single rusting metal watch-tower serves as lookout for the surrounding tents and reinforced ruins. The soldiers stationed here know that they are the first line of defense against anything that Minyostalma will throw at them.



## The Haven
#### The Northern Entrance (1/rr)
The Northern Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Northern Entrance include both allowing entrants for a fee and disallowing, by fire and force, any unidentified persons from exiting.

Entering this gate leads into [[#The Damaged Chapel (2/rr)]], where a small trail leads to [[#The Rookie Village (1/rr)]] and eventually the Haven at large.

#### The Rookie Village (1/rr)
The so-called "Rookie Village" was - at one point - a small hunting settlement by the name of Belthaenne, but it is now occupied by a number of generally unaffiliated Seekers and is managed by a negligently profitable Goliath merchant who calls himself [[Ondo]].

A thin trail connects the Rookie Village to [[#The Damaged Chapel (2/rr)]] to the east and to [[#The Levee (2/rr)]] to the south. 

#### The Damaged Chapel (2/rr)
Standing west of [[#The Rookie Village (1/rr)]], Damaged Chapel is a small compound of a main Chapel, a small Barracks, and a series of mausoleums throughout a large yard of marked graves. 

The Chapel itself is quite badly damaged, as the supporting structures of the second story have failed and caused the roof of the building to partially collapse inward - thus the name. The battles that have taken place within the building surely do not help either. Under scrutiny of the surviving religious images, two things can be known;
	- The text is [[Sylvan (language)]], and the images depict a bountiful land of nature.
	- The god worshipped here is named [[Kor-ket]], and a repeating motif is "All this is made to be yours to do what you will."

The graveyard is largely uninteresting to those who care little for the names of dead souls, but the mausoleums that scatter throughout are more interesting - once used by the resting dead, they are now used as small shelters, storage areas, and military defenses (see Embrasure).

A thin trail travels from the front door of the chapel westward towards and into [[#The Rookie Village (1/rr)]].

#### The Lone Farmstead (1/rr)
North of [[#The Rookie Checkpoint (1/rr)]], the Lone Farmstead was once an important economic feature of the growing empire. Much of the land to the Farmstead's west is now abandoned and overgrown farmland. The Farmstead itself consists of a collection of three buildings, and two ancient objects.

On the Farmstead, a small house of three rooms has been long looted of useful material. Across a small clearing, a decrepit wooden barn creaks and groans, threatening to break down at any moment in the wind. Standing tall and strong between the two other buildings on the clearing, a large stone granary and mill acts as the most defensible building on the compound.

The ancient objects seem dangerous. A curious mind would likely identify the many wheels on frame as an ancient iteration of a simple cart, but the mystery lies in its purpose and power source. 

#### The Levee (2/rr)
South of [[#The Rookie Village (1/rr)]], a large field of dead plants and puddles separates the people in the North from the dangers of [[#The Toxic Swamps (3/rr)]]. No Minyostalman structures are present here, and rather the area is named for the ditch of rubble constructed and maintained by the Rookies.

#### The Crossroads (2/rr)
West of [[#The Rookie Checkpoint (1/rr)]], a large plate of white rock forms a plus symbol on the face of the earth. At the center of this large rock crossroad, on the south-eastern side, a thin pole of this white rock emerges from the ground. Clearly broken, this pole is a sharp hazard - so much so that a corpse of a Scav is lying impaled around the pole.

#### The Rookie Checkpoint (1/rr)
East of [[#The Crossroads (2/rr)]], a large fence has been erected between [[#The Haven]] and [[#The Sticks]]. It is most commonly occupied by a number of Scavs working for [[Ondo]], defending the Haven at large from the Bandits in [[#The Sticks]].

#### The Toxic Swamps (3/rr)
The land south of [[#The Levee (2/rr)]] is the most dangerous space within [[#The Haven]]. Deep puddles of toxic irradiated water cover most of the surface within this area, were one wrong step can lead to entrapment and a slow painful death.

Continuing south or west will lead into the [[#Broken Swamps (2/rr)]] and then [[#The Cordon]] beyond it.

#### The Flea Market (1/rr)
South of [[#The Crossroads (2/rr)]] and east of [[#The Levee (2/rr)]] stands a large crumbled building known as the "Flea Market". 

What was once the ground floor has crumbled to its supports. Those few rooms that are not impassable are derelict, and devoid of occupants.

Taking the stairs from within the building or the makeshift ramp from outside will lead you to the second floor. This second floor is chock-full of independent merchants and scavs looking to flip scrap or artifacts for food, water, and ammunition.

Ascending the stairs again, the third floor is the most secure portion of the building. Here there is a ramshackle infirmary where multiple Scavs lay injured, a plethora of more connected Seekers selling their highest quality wares, and a number of hired hands pulling security through the windows and embrasures around the top floor.

The roof is generally inaccessible, as the stairs inside the building have collapsed and no other method has been manufactured by the residents. 

A basement below the main building is accessible from the ground floor, where members of less-than-friendly factions come to trade with the residents and visitors of the Flea Market. In particular, the Mercenaries always station a representative here. 

#### The Forester's Hut (1/rr)
In the south-eastern most corner of [[#The Haven]], a two-story tower marks the end of the claimed area. The tower itself is made of the same light stone of the other ancient buildings of this place, and the inside is seemingly occupied.

A man who goes by the name "Forester" lives in and defends the tower against the few threats that make their way north-west from [[#The Factory]] or [[#The Sticks]].



## The Sticks
#### The Eastern Breach (1/rr)
A breach in the massive wall around Minyostalma has been reinforced by raw sharp metals and clearly has been dug out to provide headroom as one travels through the breach and immediately into [[#The Trap Town (1/rr)]].

#### The Dark Bonfire (3/rr)
West of [[#The Trenches (2/rr)]] and North of the [[#The Logging Camp (1/rr)]], a thin patch of pine woods surrounds a clearing. In this clearing, a circular portion of the ground dips into a stone divot. The stone circle in this clearing supports an anomalous fire, a dark purple core licking out into sharp grey tips of painful flame (necrotic & fire).

#### The Trenches (2/rr)
West of [[#The Trap Town (1/rr)]], a network of shallow and narrow ravines give this location it's name, and it is the site of a number of prolonged and brutal firefights between Scavs of the Sticks and the Haven, and mobile forces from the White Flame Military, the Trenches has sustained severe damage.

#### The Trap Town (1/rr)
A small village rests in a quiet still against the north-eastern portion of the military's wall. To an uneducated Scav, this place would seem to be an unoccupied and unclaimed bounty of scrap to be had - but they are distinctly wrong. 

Under the surface of this town, in the basements and bunkers, a relatively safe "city" flourishes. The majority of the occupants of the city are independent Scavs or members of the Extramis Chapter, and can navigate through and out of the kill-field on the surface.

While on the surface, a creature entering or exiting the Town or a specific building in Town must make a DC 19 Perception Check to detect any of the traps in Town;
	- Hanging Beam; 18 DEX Save, 4d10+15 bludg.
	- Foot Noose; 21 Sleight of Hand to escape, 1d6 bludg. on 10ft fall.
	- Spikepit; 19 DEX Save, 2d10+5 piercing & 18 CON Save 4d6+20 poison or half.

#### The Logging Camp (1/rr)
East of the [[#The Rookie Checkpoint (1/rr)]], the Logging Camp is the main entrance to [[#The Sticks]] from the West.

The Camp is surrounded stumps, clearly cut during the ancient times of Minyostalma using their interesting machinery. 

A large storehouse keeps bundles of logs and a large metal cart used for logging. Another of these carts is seemingly crashed or stuck in the ground.

#### The Spike Fields (2/rr)
East of [[#The Logging Camp (1/rr)]], a large open field separates the major locations of [[#The Sticks]], and gives the area it's name. This open field is littered with natural spike pits that have been hidden by the residents of [[#The Trap Town (1/rr)]] or revealed by unlucky travelers.
	- Spikepit; 19 DEX Save, 2d10+5 piercing & 18 CON Save 4d6+20 poison or half.

#### The Dangerous Ruins (3/rr)
South of [[#The Trap Town (1/rr)]] and East of [[#The Spike Fields (2/rr)]], a construction site has clearly been ravaged by looters and firefights that have occurred there. Its rubble provides good cover, and much of the scaffolding surrounding the half-built structure remains accessible, leading to high-ground shooting positions upon the roof of the building.

#### The Pond (2/rr)
South of [[#The Logging Camp (1/rr)]], a large pond stands still, surrounded by thick forest. The water of the Pond is nearly crystal clear, leaving the surface-floor visible. There are a number of bones, both humanoid and otherwise, loose rocks, and some minor vegetation.

#### The Forest Gate (1/rr)
Directly South of [[#The Spike Fields (2/rr)]], a large gated stone fence separates [[#The Sticks]] from the greater [[#Grey Forest (4/rr)]]. Nearby the gate, a small building acts as the gate-house, and it has since been refitted as a semi-permanent residence for passing groups.

#### The Outlook (1/rr)
East of [[#The Forest Gate (1/rr)]] and South of [[#The Dangerous Ruins (3/rr)]], the Outlook is a tall stone tower unfinished in construction, but nonetheless provides a powerful spotting area for all of [[#The Sticks]]. Scaling the scaffolding would be easier than navigating the inside of the tower.



## The Factory
#### The Showroom (3/rr)
As the major entrance from [[#Broken Swamps (2/rr)]], the Showroom is a major killing-field for those who currently occupy the high-ground in the Factory.

The Showroom itself is wrapped in scaffolds, where one can navigate through the upper levels of the Factory, and in the central space, a large dais hosts a pile of rubble and trash. Heading through the halls and rooms, one arrives in [[#The Loading Bay (2/rr)]].

The Showroom is a Ground Level with access to the Basement at [[#The Arcane Chambers (8/rr)]] and the Upper at [[#The Office (2/rr)]].

#### The Arcane Chambers (8/rr)
West of [[#The Cellars (6/rr)]], the Arcane Chambers are a series of large rooms in which various arcane inscriptions, human waste, and evidence of occupation. This is the major barracks within the Factory for those without Radiation Detection.

The Arcane Chambers is a Basement Level with access to the Ground at [[#The Showroom (3/rr)]].

#### The Cellars (6/rr)
East of the [[#The Arcane Chambers (8/rr)]], the Cellars acted as a storage area for the Factory above, but having fallen into a rough cacophony of debris and corridors, the Cellars are now a dangerous hotspot for firefights.

At the end of the Cellars, a large vault-style door is locked under anomalous key. Behind this door lies a safe passage to [[#The Mess Hall (2/rr)]]'s cellar storage area.

The Cellars is a Basement Level with access to the Ground at [[#The Storage Tanks (4/rr)]].

#### The Rafters (3/rr)
Connecting the Upper Levels of the Factory, the Rafters are the primary holding position of the occupants of the Factory due to its high-ground advantage.

The Rafters is a Upper Level with access to the Ground at [[#The Storage Tanks]], [[#The Loading Bay]], [[#The Pallets]], and [[#The Stamping Line]].

#### The Storage Tanks (4/rr)
East of [[#The Showroom (3/rr)]], the Storage Tanks once were used to hold some liquid for the processes of this Factory, but now it acts as a middle-ground between the other Ground level areas.

The three large round tanks are the defining feature in this area, reaching from the Basement to the Upper Levels, a good cover or a tremendous maneuvering challenge.

The Storage Tanks is a Ground Level, with access to the Basement at [[#The Cellars (6/rr)]] and the Upper at [[#The Rafters (3/rr)]].

#### The Office (2/rr)
East of [[#The Rafters]], the Office is a section of the Upper level that has been heavily reinforced and endowed with comforts, and as such acts as the most favorable base-of-operations within the Factory. No historical artifacts can be found here, as anything the ancients left behind has been gathered and lost, leaving the room to bend to its occupants will.

The Office is a Upper Level with access to the Ground at [[#The Showroom (3/rr)]].

#### The Loading Bay (2/rr)
As the primary egress from [[#The Base]] to [[#The Cordon]], much of the Loading Bay is heavily trapped, and provides a significant advantage to any defenders within the Factory. 

A series of halls and rooms for break lead north, towards [[#The Showroom (3/rr)]]. A large set of metal double doors lie dismantled upon the ground, leaving the frame open into [[#The Pallets (3/rr)]].

The Loading Bay is a Ground Level with access to the Upper at [[#The Rafters (3/rr)]].

#### The Pallets (3/rr)
South of [[#The Storage Tanks (4/rr)]], a series of metal pallets have been stacked atop each other in this large warehouse space. 

A large set of metal double doors exits [[#The Factory]], and a wide stone path leads into [[#The Construction Site (4/rr)]]] of [[#The City]]. 

Another set of double doors would section the Pallets and [[#The Loading Bay (2/rr)]], but instead lie dismantled upon the ground, leaving the frame open and accessible. 

Opposing this open doorframe, a third set of large metal doors stands strong, and leads into [[#The Stamping Line (3/rr)]].

The Pallets is a Ground Level with access to the Upper at [[#The Rafters (3/rr)]].

#### The Stamping Line (3/rr)
East of [[#The Pallets]], a series of machines and conveyers link and weave across the ground of this area. Much of the materials that make the insides of these machines have been thoroughly scavenged, and left to bear.

A large set of metal double doors separates the Stamping Line from [[#The Pallets (3/rr)]]. Another smaller set of doors leads through to a pair of rooms and then the [[#The Importing Pallets (2/rr)]].

The Stamping Line is a Ground Level with access to the Upper at [[#The Rafters (3/rr)]].



## The City
#### The Offices, North (6/rr)
West of [[#The Arched Road (4/rr)]] & [[#The Fountain Park (8/rr)]], a large cluster of relatively stable-looking four-story buildings remain standing above the surrounding ruins. The interior of the Offices is crusty, dirty, and largely undisturbed; many rooms are divided into cubicles, each keeping a powerless workstation, a set of writing utensils, and a swath of unintelligible documentation rests, covered in years of dust.

A select few of the cubicles have become overgrown with dark green vines and leaves, and attract small insects or rodents into the Offices.

The spaces that have been disturbed here are obvious, where bloodstains and strewn furniture suggest that the most common travelers here are either injured, and looking to camp, or hunting for easy prey.

#### The Arched Road (4/rr)
The entrance to this city is a massive carved arch, standing over a once glorious road, which has overgrown into a thick, impassable, wall of foliage. Nature has aggressively reclaimed this place, leaving worn cobblestone and grand carving buried in dense green life.

#### The Construction Site (4/rr)
The Construction Site is east of [[#The Arched Road (4/rr)]], and north of [[#The Mall (6/rr)]]. The site is composed of a few tall tower-cranes, a few dozen foundations, and tons of construction material. The area is spaced as all the other buildings in the city are, but the buildings themselves are missing, leaving the area very open to visual inspections.

#### The Offices, South (4/rr)
See [[#The Offices, North (6/rr)]].

#### The Fountain Park (8/rr)
South of [[#The Arched Road (4/rr)]], a grand cobblestone square is centered around a large bowl fountain that has since ceased flowing. Much of the northern section of the park is succumbing to nature, leaving the majority of the park bare of life. 

#### The Mall (6/rr)
East of [[#The Fountain Park (8/rr)]] and south of [[#The Construction Site (4/rr)]], the largest building in the city stands tall and wide. Three stories of carved stone, each over 1000 square feet of dense halls, stores, and backrooms, most all of which has been taken and shaped into a tactical symphony.

This place was once under the control of a savage gang of bandit-scavs following the leadership of one 'Bloody Nial', who doused the area in visual and psychological horrors in an attempt to maintain their control, but has since been liberated into the control of [[The People...#Mercenaries]], thanks to 'Ash' and the rest of 'Delta 3'.

#### The Apartments, West (4/rr)
South of [[#The Offices, North (6/rr)]] and [[#The Fountain Park (8/rr)]], the Apartments look skeletal and decrepit, where patios and balconies are broken off and away, major portions of wall are blown out. Pieces of furniture or boards block out the windows, as if trying to hide the interior of this bleeding ruin.

#### The Apartments, East (4/rr)
See [[#The Apartments, West (4/rr)]].

#### The Hospital (8/rr)
West of [[#The Apartments, West (4/rr)]], and south of [[#The Mall (6/rr)]], the Hospital is overgrown with vines and foliage. The two stories of the building separate into bureaucracy and surgery. A basement grants the space additional storage.

The Hospital lies host to a clutch of [[The Monsters...#The Demon]] in its basement, and acts as a base of operations to the Fallen in the upper floors.



## The Village
#### The Hovels (4/rr)

#### The Homes (4/rr)

#### The Villas (4/rr)

#### The Fields (4/rr)

#### The Market (4/rr)

#### The Outskirts, North (2/rr)

#### The Windmill (2/rr)

#### The Empty Fences (4/rr)

#### The Outskirts, South (6/rr)




## The Temple
#### The Open Cloister (10/rr)
A beautiful garden ends [[#The City]]'s road south. Spotted with finely crafted benches, tables, and chairs, the Open Cloister plays host to a fun party game; the hedge maze. It remains meticulously maintained.

Passing the tables and chairs east will lead to [[#The North Gate (10/rr)]], while passing through the hedge maze will lead south, into [[#The Graveyard (14/rr)]] and which will [[#The Dormitories (14/rr)]].

#### The North Gate (10/rr)
The Obelisk has claimed the North Gate with thick vines and foliage, making passage North inaccessible from here. The space around the gate was once a beautiful work of marble or concrete - pristine fountains and statues of heroes - but time has added grunge, grime, and damage. Bags of sand, empty magazines, and bloodied bricks mark the battles that occurred here clearly.

Following the pathways East or West will lead to [[#The Broken Tower (10/rr)]] and [[#The Open Cloister (10/rr)]] respectively, but above all else, the North Gate is an entryway to [[#The Temple Proper (20/rr)]], a grand but broken beast of a building.

#### The Broken Tower (10/rr)
East of [[#The North Gate (10/rr)]], the Broken Tower stands tall and bold, casting a tall shadow upon the horizon. In a courtyard of eroded stone columns and faded carvings, a thick white tower stands frozen in time; in most places, this grand tower is breaking apart, bricks are cracked and falling from the rest of the building, and a massive rupture scales the northern side of the tower, leaving portions of the interior quite visible. Once wonderous stained glass windows are blown out, covering the area in polychrome beams and shadows.

Whatever anomalous effect holds the tower in its state of immutability has no effect on living things, as evidenced by the newly overgrown sections around the base of the rip-scar and by the vermin rushing to hide from your sight.

A cut path leaves the Tower south, heading towards the [[#The Temple Garden (14/rr)]].

#### The Graveyard (14/rr)

#### The Temple Proper (20/rr)

#### The Temple Garden (14/rr)

#### The Dormitories (14/rr)

#### The South Gate (10/rr)

#### The Stable Tower (8/rr)





## The Base
#### The Importing Pallets (2/rr)
East of [[#The Front Gate (2/rr)]], a large garage door stinks offensively of death and gunpowder. The Importing Pallets are functionally a kill-box for those coming from excursions through [[#The Factory]], as a large portion of the furniture and pallets within this space have been refit into a thin maze. 

#### The Front Gate (2/rr)
The path leading south from the [[#Grey Forest (4/rr)]] leads directly to the Base's Front Gate, where a large lawn makes for a beautiful scene in the front of the brutalist military compound.

Entering the building and heading West, [[#The Importing Pallets (2/rr)]] await the unsuspecting Scav, and on the opposite side, doors lead into [[#The Mess Hall (2/rr)]].

#### The Mess Hall (2/rr)
West of [[#The Front Gate (2/rr)]], the Mess Hall is a bloody mess of a cafeteria, covered in dry blood, ruined food-stuff, and human waste.

A small kitchen is attached, but has been since looted and fairly obstructed, but those who can slip through would a storage room. On a wall of this cellar, a large vault-style door is locked under anomalous key. Behind this door lies a safe passage to [[#The Factory]]'s [[#The Cellars (6/rr)]].

#### The Broken Gate (3/rr)
West of [[#The Intelligence Center (4/rr)]], outside, a grass strip behind the building has been covered in broken glass and snapped metals. The gate surrounding [[#The Base]] has been broken here, but provides little egress, as one must blaze a trail through [[#Grey Forest (4/rr)]] before finding their way - a dangerous task.

#### The Intelligence Center (4/rr)
In the center of [[#The Base]], south of [[#The Front Gate (2/rr)]] & north of [[#The Old Barracks (2/rr)]], the Intelligence Center was once the headquarters of the Ancient Elven Military. A large circular room is scattered with dozens of broken machines, strewn papers, and covered in blood and blaster marks.

A claustrophobic series of halls and blast doors connect The Intelligence Center and the rest of [[#The Base]].

#### The Armory (4/rr)
East of [[#The Intelligence Center (4/rr)]], the path to the Armory descends into gated sections of boxed goods, weapon racks, and armor stands. The majority of the gates have been opened, and their contents looted, but one locked section remains unlooted.

#### The Infirmary (3/rr)
West of [[#The Old Barracks (2/rr)]], the Infirmary is a small section of [[#The Base]] where separated each of the rooms contain a couple beds and medical equipment, but they are all in great disarray.

#### The Old Barracks (2/rr)
South of [[#The Intelligence Center (4/rr)]], the Old Barracks is seperated from the main building by a small dirt path. In it's time, it was once a warehouse of bunks and lockers, but in the half-century that has passed since it has become re-occupied, the Barracks has genuinely exploded. 

Of what remains, the foundation and a portion of the southern walls remain, but the entire north side of the building has been sundered, and leaves the area more difficult than worthwhile in a tactical situation.

#### The Hangars (4/rr)
South of [[#The Armory (4/rr)]], three large garages stand suspiciously intact. While they are each and all covered in evidence of a firefight, there is no damage to the buildings themselves.

The westernmost hangar is larger than the others, and each of the two personnel doors remain impassable. The hangar door however, can be forced open. This has led a series of groups to lay claim to this hangar as their hideout - and evidence of this inhabitance remains. 

The central hangar's personnel doors are unlocked and openable. Inside, a large machine made of a transparent metal and glowing lights takes most of the interior. There is a box of food and water in the small office, hidden in the floor beneath the filing cabinet.
