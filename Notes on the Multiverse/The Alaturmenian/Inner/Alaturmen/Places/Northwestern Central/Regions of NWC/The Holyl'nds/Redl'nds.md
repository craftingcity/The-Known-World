	- A large in-earth marking has been ruined. The remaining stones are carved with script ([[Sylvan (language)]]) that impresses a religious use, but little detail can be gleaned. The wear of the script on the stones also suggests that this marking is old; these stones were considered worn long before they were broken.

	- A large steel boulder is cored and has been made a small shelter for a now dead Giant. Marked in Primordial, it describes the life of the Giant who lived here.
