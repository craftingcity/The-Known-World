#### Kohnstamm Experimental Genetics Facility
The EGF is one of the many multi-story buildings in Kohnstamm, shining a bright white against the otherwise grey surroundings. Operated by the Ideology Correction Corps, the EGF has been in operation since the turn of the century, c.100AF, where two generations of 'experimental populai' have been generated and released into the caste system.
##### Reception
The ground floor of the EGF is a genuine hospital, receiving and treating patients for minor injuries or diseases.

##### Offices and Research
The second floor of the EGF is composed of offices and small clean rooms used for 'dry experiments' regarding the genetics research being done here.

##### Barracks
The third floor of the EGF is a series of cul-de-sac style living quarters, including built-in kitchen and laundry facilities, and secure armories. 

##### Experiments
The fourth floor of the EGF is composed of four large configurable 'experimentation chambers' where live subjects are forced to complete a series of tests or activities.

##### Containment
The fifth floor of the EGF is a secure holding facility for the living beings used as subjects in these experiments.

##### Basement
The basement floor of the EGF is a large butcher/kitchen operation that takes the corpses of the subjects here and turns them into food for the surviving subjects.
