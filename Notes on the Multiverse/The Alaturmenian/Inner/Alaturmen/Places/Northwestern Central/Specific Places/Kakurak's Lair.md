# Kakurak's Lair

The Adult Bronze dragon Kakurak (120 years) lives in a wet cave edged to the [[Firelight Sea]] in the [[The Holyl'nds|Lands of the Great White Flame]]. He keeps a satyr druid Marcus as his servant and companion, and tasks himself with protecting the people of the Known World.

## Cave Enterence

Its the entrance to his cave lair! The lake outside makes it wet in this room, and the floor is slick with slime and water. A large opening leads to the main hall.

## Main Hall

Each of the other rooms in this Lair are connected to this main chamber, either by long corridors or simple openings. This room is much drier, largely because of the massive white bondfire in the center of the room inset into the floor. To any that look with intent to the fire, it looks back.

## Marcus' Room

Marcus lives in a large 30' circular chamber. He has a large bed of wet moss, a beautifully carved set of wooden dining furniture (where he and Kakurak will often share meals), a dresser, natural carved shelf (upon which he keeps his few trinkets of home and mementos of his life past).

### Marcus' Kitchen

Attached to Marcus' room, a kitchenette and a storage room for food.

## GoW Vault 3

The door to this room is a thick lead, and has two locks (both of DC 25).

In this large rectangular hall, lead plates cover the carved space here. Dark steel pedestals stand around the room, holding items of great power. This is the Guild of Wizards' Vault 3, one of the 'containment vaults' that store items and objects that should be kept out of the public's hands.

## Treasure Room

Kakurak keeps this room well sorted, with each type of item having its own space.

In the center of the room Kakurak sleeps on a large pile of coins, gems, and loose jewelry.

Many magical scrolls and gems are sorted in shelves and racks that line the northern wall of this room. Weapons and armor of beautiful craft are placed on racks in the east and west.

## Kakurak's Study

In his study, many bookshelves hold tomes of knowledge. A formidable collection. A pair of armchairs flank a fireplace and a small table with a decanter and two glasses. In the northeastern corner of the room, a marble table holds a *crystal ball of true seeing, mind reading, and identifying*. On a raised pedestal in the center of the room a carved and black-with-gold-speckles chalked *teleportation circle* lies.

## Guests Quarters

This room is kept in good array, and contains humanoid bedding for up to six.
