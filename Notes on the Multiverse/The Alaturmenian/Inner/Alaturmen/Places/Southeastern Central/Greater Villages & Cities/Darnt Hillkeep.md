# Description
## History

The Darnt Hillkeep was once two worlds. The city of Darnt, a human settlement, growing and growing faster than it can sustain, and the [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]]'s large, beautiful, opulent, and empty halls. When they met, it was clear that their people would become intertwined economically, but few expected as much cultural integration as what has occured.

## Notable Locations
The [[Castle Darnt]] is home to [[Baron Jammu]], of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]], and there she keeps her standing army and her wealth.

The Halls of [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]] are generally known and referred to as "Hillkeep", and it is a large shallow connection of homes and work sites that make up much of the hills here.
