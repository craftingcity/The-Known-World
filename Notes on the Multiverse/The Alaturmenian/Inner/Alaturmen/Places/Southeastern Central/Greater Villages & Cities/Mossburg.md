### "Quote"

### General Public Disposition

### Background
Steeped deeply in the history of active resistance and warfare of [[Bandit Lords]], Mossburg was built as one of the first major settlements in the southern region of [[Central Alaturmen]]. 

In the early 20s, as Fire rages in the north-west, the east faces intense war - alliances are formed and broken, and the threat of the [[Bandit Lords]] expanding south forces Mossburg to insulate its government from its people.

As the Bandit Lords fell, and consolidated their waning power back north, Mossburg became a symbol for those who wished to live a civil life, and the city's number swelled.

The Mossburg Enforcers became overwhelmed. They chose efficiency over diligence, and for three generations, the Enforcers have used their leverage over the populace to disappear people and force their families to work to the bone to see them again.
