# Level Three: Sinker
The third level of Kailkeep is the final drops of the sweet promised nothings the Kobolds sing in the form of defamation, claims of guarded but abandoned treasures, and unlooted corpses. These are the final lies that will seal an uninformed grave.

The transition from "dwarven outpost" to the true Hells of Kaillkeep is sudden, and immediate. It should seem as though it is simply the next method of progression, and it is in this moment that Kailkeep shakes the unprepared adventurer to their core. From beautifully carved stone and dark chambers to bloody glowing walls full of screens protecting hundreds of cheering kobolds.

If music is a part of your game, now is the time to switch from "Epic Fantasy" to "Hyperpop Rage".
