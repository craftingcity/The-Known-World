# Kailkeep
A number of notes, clues, warnings, and "red herrings" have been left by the unlucky entertainers of Kailkeep for as long as it has existed

Given Kailkeep's nature as a living, breathing place, the following notes should only act as a base from which to build and create your own narrative through *~environmental storytelling~*.

## L1-3; The Allure
While there are no notes from passing adventurers here (whether from Terra's influence or an ignorance of need), but rather art and tapestries describe the false tale of the first settlers of this place.

## L4; [[d_ Chapter Five - Level Four; Four Corners]]
Four Corners is nearly the most "literature populated" layer of Kailkeep, second only to Pick-Up Sticks and it's ecological anomalies.
