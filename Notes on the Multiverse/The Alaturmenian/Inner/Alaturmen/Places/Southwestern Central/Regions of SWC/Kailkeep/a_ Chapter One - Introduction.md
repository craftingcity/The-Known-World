# The Hells of Kailkeep
## An Ode to Tucker's Kobolds
### Let me tell you a story...
In the Time before Time, for a moment and forever, the goblins thrived in the soup of Primordial nothing. Right after that, one single moment later, [[Tetrimoc]] split the heavens of Alaturmen and threw himself down unto it. There he was given his first wound by the lone mountain known now as Kailkeep. 

From the blood sprayed across this mountain rose the Kobolds of Kailkeep. Long did they wait for their Master to claim them, but he slept for too long, his injury too large. The Kobolds claimed themselves, disavowed their creator god and swore to work only for themselves. Without the direction of Tetrimoc, they became wicked and cruel.

Kailkeep is a massive complex dug by a fanatical group of Kobold for two main purposes; first, the safety of themselves, and second, the torment of others. They rule this massive complex, and even stronger monsters respect them as the true keepers of Kailkeep – except one, with whom the collective of kobold work as equal: Terra, the Idol of Earth. Why Terra began to work with them, I would dare not ask, but she has surely become as horrible as they are.

## About rules stuff
Above it's third level, Kailkeep presents a challenge constructed for three to five 'level five adventurers' working together as a team with the limited information presented about the natures of Kailkeep's Hells. As they progress, they should gain experience as you see fit, but know that the mechanical challenge presented will rise in difficulty further up the floors one goes.

## Hooks
### Druids of Terra
For some time, the Druids of Terra were hidden, guarding the secrets of Arcane magic. Recently, the druid's connection to Terra has been severed – for reasons they would not share, even if they knew – and many of their texts have been stolen. Perhaps the adventurers were exploring and stumbled upon the hidden druids, or were sought out for their prowess. In either case, if the Druids can trust them, they would ask for their assistance in these affairs. And even if they can't be trusted, maybe they would anyways, but be prepared to ambush these assholes if they return with information.

### Missing People
For as long as there has been a mountain, there have been people bored enough to want to climb it. When those people travel to Kailkeep, either for fun or profit, they do not return. The explorer's husband is distraught, as is the Cartagrophers' Guild, and so too are the dwarfs failing to set up a remote operation without their Quartermaster, Explosives Expert, or Cooks.

### God-damn Raiders!
The inhabitants of Kailkeep are sustained by hunting as well as gathering. When people are not coming to them, they must come to people. If the Kobolds have been having a rough year, they'll either send raids themselves or order one of the factions under their command to raid for them.

### Arcane Hotspot
In a world where magic is not so common, the amount of magical items alone here would ping someone's radar, ignoring the powerful primordial force of Terra forsaking her druids and moving into a mountain. Anyone attuned to the Weave feels the heat of arcane density in the area of Kailkeep, even from afar.

If your setting is of a higher commonality of magic, this hook becomes much simpler; go get the loot - *its magic!*

## Philosophy
From a design perspective, I wish to present a series of problems that ask for a quick or precise solution, lest the consequences come to pass. Often times, as in other games, the consequence for failure in Kailkeep is fatal, but please tailor your game's content to your table. Talk with them about the story they want to tell, and if it isn't one of bleak survival but rather rampant obliteration of evil, this is not a module designed to provide the ladder experience.

This is an experience built for players to survive and run from, not beat. Put a little fear back in the hearts and minds of your friends, family, or otherwise. I chose Kobolds as my muse because of the Tale of Tucker's Kobolds. Its funny, but I wished for a more Griffon McElroy's Wonderland than the basic power-dungeon designing kobolds. So, I built Kailkeep.

I wanted the freedom to do what Tucker couldn't, which is bust his Kobolds to fucking bits. These shits work some of the best metals on the plane and have captured / partnered with a ***primordial idol***. They watch deadly rooms behind walls of impenetrable yet transparent rock. They *want* you here. So they can torture you. 

But not your players. Again, this should be a dark, stormy night of **fun**.

## Running Kailkeep
For the purposes of running this module "from the book"; No matter where the players ascend from, they enter somewhere on the next level presented here – some intervention by the fates, perhaps. 

You should understand that the levels presented here only explore a small portion of this massive structure. When your players go off-script, feel free to build something you think is on theme, or rip something from further along (and then mark it – you'll have to replace it before anyone goes there). I've tried to include notes on my designs throughout, so you might better understand my intentions as I watch these Kobolds craft an adventure for their own entertainment.

### About the Kobolds
The Kobolds of Kailkeep have gone half-mad with the perceived betrayal of their Blood-Master [[Tetrimoc]]. They are the rulers of Kailkeep, and the other inhabitants know it. They formed and maintain the Hells for their entertainment, and they coincidentally collect power in the form of equipment or recruits.

Groups of Kobold who commit a grievous crime are sentenced to Kailkeep's Hells. Some Kobold who feel they have no other prospects volunteer as to enter the Hells as a Champion of Kailkeep.

The many kobold "civilians" who work and keep Kailkeep, both it's Hells and Proper, enjoy spending time with their clutchmates and watching the higher levels of the Hells on their free time. Some lucky kobold make good bets on particular newcomers and gain spectacular winnings. Generally, they spend this newfound wealth investing in prospects, betting again, then losing, but some keep winning and the economy of Kailkeep flows.

##### The Kobold's Goals
1. First and foremost, the Kobolds of Kailkeep want to protect themselves. Their survival is the most important thing to them both as a collective and individually; a Kobold values their clutchmate's security over their own life. If they fucked up and got caught out, they're gonna do their best to make their death a overall benifit to the clutch. Thankfully, the Hells of Kailkeep provide a very thorough defense. 
2. Secondarily, the Kobolds want to gain more power than they have now. Again, this is true of the individual and the collective, some Kobolds run the Hells for a chance for a change of fate, and all Kobolds want Kobolds to rule Alaturmen (just like everyone else does, right?).
3. Tertiarily, the Kobolds want to appease their partner, Terra, and their followers. The easiest way to do that is to entertain them while they are well-fed and warm-bedded.

## Kailkeep's Secrets
### Viewer's Favor
Kailkeep's worst kept secret is what it's real purpose is; entertainment for a colony of Kobolds who harbor evils for fun and profit. When the viewers of this entertainment are very pleased with a particular performer, they may spend some of their personal wealth to leave a boon to them in a "scoreboard" room. This can range from basic survival equipment to magical weaponry or armoring. 

### Proving Grounds
While the Hells of Kailkeep are used as a method of collecting resources, punishing wrongdoers, and entertaining the masses, it also acts as a system of recruitment; "Hey, if you're good enough to do that once, we'll kit you out and pay you to do it again". Sometimes the winners say yes. The alternative is a life bound in a tomb of lies, as we all saw entering this place.

### Vast Arcane Power
For whatever reason, the Kobolds of Kailkeep have access to Terran's arcane teachings, and those who have learned the craft of geomancy and work the Hells are known as Operators, and they bend the stone of the mountain to their will. Those who don't are just known as geomancers, but the Kailkeep Innards are a different Module. 

Of the many arcane secrets the Kobolds of Kailkeep have mastered, the art of creating cheap enchanted weaponry is one of them. The only cost is a curse! 

Some curses can be worked with, others cannot. Those that can are typically worn and reproduced for those that would benefit. Those that cannot are given as false boons to those inside the Hells, adding some hope to their lives, and some spice to the Kobold's Entertainment.

### Corrupted Dragon
Long ago, when the Kobolds were first crafting Kailkeep's Hells, the dragons [[Kakurak]] and Luzikiemal visited. There, Kakurak met his greatest ally. And there, Luzikiemal perished. 

Since that time, the Kobolds of Kailkeep have reanimated and corrupted the corpse of [[#Luzikiemal, Risen]] as a set piece in their entertainment.

## Inhabitants of Kailkeep
There are two large categories of creatures that Inhabit Kailkeep; the first are the intelligent factions, those capable of understanding and attempting to progress within Kailkeep's Hells. The second are the less-than intelligent groups, such as the beasts and insects - the more "natural" residents who have no reason to leave or understanding of what where they are really is.

### Intelligent Factions
#### Kobolds of Kailkeep
The Masters of Kailkeep watch from their posts, behind walls of transparent stone, changing the floors and walls in some effort to enact a sick game upon those who enter their home and lair. As each level is introduced and explored, the Kobold Gang on that level continues alongside the adventurers, becoming a more present threat as the characters continue upward.

###### Rammik's Gang
Led by a red kobold - Rammik - this well-equipped gang hails from the fourth layer, and have earned a reputation for their lack of remorse during gameplay. Rammik himself is a coward at heart though, leading by impersonation, and he will preserve his own life over those among his team with stunning speed.

###### Yellowback's Gang
Led by a yellow kobold - Yellowback - this cunning gang hails from the fifth layer, and have earned a reputation for their explosive presentation during gameplay. Yellowback spends some of his time creating alchemical agents, both for defense and offense, and he allows his most trusted associates to wield them.

###### Kasey Bullseye's Gang
Led by a bronze kobold - Kasey Bullseye - this well-prepared gang hails from the sixth layer, and have earned a reputation for their familiarity with the sixth layer of the Hells. The gang exploits information they have collected about the layout of an area of the sixth layer - specifically the scoreboard, exit game, and less destructive trap rooms - to lure those who enter "their territory" to their death.

###### Pinky's Gang
Led by a red kobold - Pinky - this sorcerous gang hails from the seventh layer, and have earned a reputation for their proficiency in disabling or even capturing other participants without physical damage to either side. Pinky has been able to teach magic to some of her followers, increasing their survivability as a team and as individual operators.

###### Shuckster's Gang
Leb by a yellow kobold - Shuckster - this mutated gang hails from the eighth layer, and have earned a reputation for their beastly forms and pack tactics. Somehow, Shuckster and the gang have become largely mutated kobold-beast hybrids, and this has obviously affected their playstyle, as they have abandoned the 'slow and steady' tactics they used in the lower levels for a more impulsive, hungry strategy.


#### Goblin Squads
Many Goblin of Kailkeep are loyal to the Kobolds, creating entertainment and material products for them. While these workers are respected as an integral part of Kailkeep's economy, they are still considered cannon-fodder to their Masters - excepting these few with military intelligence whom they have equipped and formed into so-called hit-squads who roam a given layer with the intent of exterminating the highest scoring group present.

###### 'Vulture Talons' Squad
The 'Vulture's Talons' Squad earn their name for their scavenger-like tactics, where the squad will lie in wait for their target to resolve a conflict with some other group, and then 'swoop in' to make their kill.

###### 'Sneaking Mantis' Squad
The 'Sneaking Mantis' Squad

###### 'Gorilla Fists' Squad
The 'Gorilla Fists' Squad

###### 'Bear Hug' Squad
The 'Bear Hug' Squad

###### 'Cat's Claw' Squad
The 'Cat's Claw' Squad

#### Goblin Dissenters
Not all of the Goblin of Kailkeep are loyal to the Kobolds. Some fight their way through Kailkeep as any other civilized person would, wishing to ascend and escape. Generally, these Goblins will gather together for the protection community provides, and fly the banner of one of the Blood Clans, for recognition more than any real relation.

###### Scrivin Gang
###### Garqwak Gang
###### Bulgpim Gang
###### Wheernat Gang

#### Black Gnoll
The Gnoll that find themselves in Kailkeep typically develop a black tint in their fur from the dusty stone present throughout the Hells. Many Gnoll find their hunger satisfied in Kailkeep and stay upon their ascension, but some do not, and are cast to the lower levels or killed.

###### Bloodylip's Pack
hails from the fourth layer
###### Dusk's Pack
hails from the fifth layer
###### Reaper's Pack
hails from the sixth layer
###### Lynch's Pack
hails from the seventh layer

#### Survivalists
People with little to no training have been taken to the Hells as long as the Hells have existed. Few are capable of surviving while retaining their morality, *and* their intelligence. These are those few.

###### Hasten's Group
###### Niurna's Group
###### Zack's Group
###### Swero's Group
###### Martin's Group

#### Reformed Entertainers
Whores of glory who have turned from morality in favor of ease and selfishness. They play towards the crowd *too well* to still be a well-adjusted person.

###### Johnlock's Gang
###### Hannibal's Gang
###### Serina's Gang
###### Kho-Kade's Gang
###### Pax's Gang

#### Ancients of Mountainhall
For as long as Kailkeep has been, the Dwarves of Mountainhall have fought within it. Squads are sent to Kailkeep when they commit horrible crimes, or under brave and foolish command. Few survive to old age, but all dwarves in Kailkeep are Ancients.

#### Golden Claw Guard
Whole squads of [[Golden Claws]] of [[The Golden City]] find their way into Kailkeep when they aren't careful on patrol – a folly of incompetence, arrogance, or genuine ignorance.

#### Honorable Thieves
Trained thieves and pirates have banded together on the bond of their shared lifestyle; and honoring [[The Code of Thieves]] as their highest law.

#### Gaund Loyalists
A pre-Alaturmen reptilian people – Gaund – are loyal to the Kobolds of Kailkeep. They reside in the Higher levels of Kailkeep in isolationist societies. Gaund have no desire to ascend, for cultural or intellectual reasons I would not know.

### Beasties
#### Ankheg, Kruthik, Wurm, Carrion Crawler
Insects abound the levels of Kailkeep, surviving on the flesh of their kills, or, when husbanded by the "stable" communities, their feed.

#### Ooze
Because of their stagnant nature, the Ooze of Kailkeep are often considered fixtures more than living beings. They are commonly husbanded in the Hells of Kailkeep as defensive or janitorial measures.

#### Unusual Rodents
The density of Woven material in the area of Kailkeep has done *something* to the rodents here. Many are larger, more ferocious, and more difficult to deal with. Some create a massive amount of children and husband extremely well. Some can fucking fly. Shits crazy.

#### Genoid
A species of earth elemental came with Terra, and hosting them is a small price to pay for her power. The Kobolds acknowledge these small rock creatures as honored guests, much as a deist would honor an Angel of their God. Those Genoid that walk the Hells are revered by Loyalists and hunted as prized kills by the other factions.

#### Mad-walkers
Those who survive Kailkeep for too long lose their sanity. One can only take so much of this torturous place. Those who continue to survive do so as Mad-walkers, more a beast of Kailkeep than a person at this point.

### Mini-bosses
#### Bernet, Lodestone Golem
#### Yeeqzu'g, Mad-speaker
#### Luzikiemal, Risen

## Kailkeep's Features
#### Terra's Mountain
The Idol of Earth, Terra (or another powerful-earth-manipulating entity who would fit in your setting), has claimed this mountain as her lair. Whether that is a choice she made herself is up to you as the game-master. On Alaturmen, Terra abandoned her Druids after learning that her sibling, Anima, had betrayed Terra's secrets to their Druids without her permission or knowledge. In a fit of rage, she sundered her Druids' grove and took much of her own teachings with her as she fled to the greatest place of refuge known on Alaturmen; Kailkeep.

#### False Allure
In its lowest floors, the first three, Kailkeep is a carefully crafted dungeon of "false allure" – sandstone cobble halls weaving a tale of mystery and woe, promises of dark treasures left behind in a great abandonment. The antagonist in this story is a Kobold Wizard who binds an elemental to do his bidding and destroy the people who were here before. As the story carved into the reliefs, columns, and in the arts remaining unfolds, promises of hidden riches and weaponry higher up inside the mountain are made, before suddenly...

## The Hells of Kailkeep
### The World's Biggest Entertainment Center
Kailkeep has been crafted from the **red sandstone** of the mountain by Kobolds for hundreds of years. It is so large and complex a structure that not all of it could be displayed here. 

The first three levels present very little challenge to even the greenest adventurers, ideally, forming some sense of Allure or Promise. Veterans should be presented with the feeling of unease – prey being lured into a trap.

A map of Kailkeep's Hells would be *wish*ful thinking to acquire outside the Hells themselves, and even then, within the mountain, the procurement of such a valuable piece of information would be quite the feat – let alone the questions of Kailkeep's ability to even be mapped, as Operators shape, reshape, and shape again.

### Entering Kailkeep
Kailkeep is a massive structure, too big to map here. If one were to avoid the obvious entrances, no matter where you enter the mountain, you would eventually find yourself in the structure of Kailkeep.

The Kobolds keep service entrances from which they and their loyalists come and go, as well as the three first floors of the Hells of Kailkeep; The False Allure. The False Allure has many entrances around the base of the mountain.

Almost all exposed caves have been converted into parts of the False Allure or the restricted areas the Kobolds keep under heavy enhanced guard.

### Hells Architecture
The fourth level presents a drastic change of theme. Where once there was red cobble and dusty crypt, there is now flat black marble walls and translucently thin stone stronger than steel surrounded by blasts of color and symbol. Beyond the first three levels, the dungeons of Kailkeep serve as a mix of entertainment, punishment, and training for the residents of Kailkeep.

The only way *out* is ***through***.

##### Ceilings
The ceilings of Kailkeep's Hells are crafted to fit at most Large creatures' height, the distance from ceiling to floor is typically eighteen feet.

##### Veiwings and Tunnels
In some places of Kailkeep, there are windows of an incredibly thin, strong, and translucent stone. Behind them, Kobolds gather to view and bet on their favorite teams inside Kailkeep's Hells. 

Between the areas of viewing, there are tunnels sized for two small creatures to walk side by side, about five by four and a half feet and spiraling staircases of similar sizing between levels.

##### Doors, Secret Doors, and Ko-Bolted Doors.
Beyond the "false allure" of Kailkeep's Lower Hells, Normal Doors (including double doors) are made of two inch thick black marble, and are handled in one-half inch thick white marble rings. These doors have no hinges, swinging around an internal cylinder of stone that holds the door in place in the wall.

The secret doors of Kailkeep are not uniform, but they are hidden at similar skill. Any and all secret doors marked on the maps are humbly suggested to require a DC 20 investigation check to notice, although surely some are easier or harder to spot then others. Please use your discretion.

Some doors in Kailkeep are "Ko-Bolted", meaning they cannot (as enforced by an Operator's magic) be opened by any other than a living Kobold who has been Marked with the correct Access Bindings.

> ###### What the fuck is an Access Binding??
> It's like a keycard in a video game, except its a magic tattoo. Only certain Kobolds get access to the tunnel doors on certain levels, because you don't need the dude who maintains the slime pits to get into the pristine puzzle rooms; what if he goops the place up?
> No-one with an Access Binding is allowed to Entertain in the Hells, for the hopefully obvious reason of the massive advantage and security threat they present. They do maintenance work whenever an area is clear of Entertainers, and some Operators go so far as to temporarily enclose areas in stone to work in peace.

##### Illumination
The Kobolds who view the Hells as entertainment typically have no need for light. In most cases, the light the entertainers provide for themselves is sufficient.

##### Formatted Markings
Markings that are not magically hidden from Terra and the Operators are formatted in with the date as mm-dd-yyy and a two centimeter wide, one centimeter deep border. Whenever any member of the [[Grand Pantheon]] or the concept of a higher power is mentioned, Terra's name is made its replacement upon formatting.

##### Scoreboard
Around Kailkeep there are "scoreboard" rooms. These places are often small, and dense with messages. 

The main feature of this room, however, is the indented wall and extended 2' slab below it. The slab is enchanted to display an image of the viewer's hand in its center. The indent, too is enchanted, and when one's hand is pressed to the slab below, a bank of information is accessed and returned to the illusion, publicly displaying the betting odds (vs the current Main Contenders) and "entertainment rating" of the owner of the hand, given they are still alive, and compared to their most direct competitors.

Generally, a player's character's rating should rise as they ascend the levels of Kailkeep, and - setting depending - should begin around three hundred, hinting at the current population of competitors upon their first interaction with the scoreboard.

##### Restricted Teleportation
As benefit to the Kobold's control of their Entertainers, Terra has restricted the effectiveness of teleportation magic - including major effects such as *plane shift* - to function only within the area from which the teleportation occurs. No barriers between rooms or tunnels can be passed through by means of teleportation.
