> ##### Advice from the Alexandrian
> "*Contextualize the content.*"

> By which I mean that you simply need to either (a) place the encounter within the context of the game world or (b) create a context that will become part of the game world.
> Let’s take the specific example of a wandering monster. When you roll up a wandering monster, ask yourself four questions:
