# Level Four: Four Corners
The fourth layer of Kailkeep harbors the first major game-as-progression. At points throughout the level, a large square room contains the game; four equal quarters are separated by a waist-high barrier. On two opposing sides, two chambers hold the competing teams, and hanging in the center is a large cage that contains the threat - and the escape. 

Getting to the game is no small task however, but the introduction of the Scoreboard rooms does present a glimmer of hope. The new dangers of the true Hells are common now, and the party's reputation should be coalescing in the collective audience's mind.

## Exploring this Place
### Navigation
#### Red Rover (Entrance Game)
- Red Rover pits two teams - "Home" and "Away" against one another, and provides a severe advantage to the "Home" team, in that they are more informed about what is to happen, where the opposition is, and what is at stake.
- The "Home" team is collected by containing a wandering team on this level. The "Away" team is collected by containing an ascending team from the previous level.
- The Goal of the game is to eliminate the opposing team's players and increase your Entertainment Rating. 
	- A "Home" team victory is rewarded with a series of healing salves, recreational drugs, and rations.
	- An "Away" team victory is not rewarded in any way other than an increase in Entertainment Rating.
#### Ways
#### Scoreboard Rooms
- A scoreboard room is a place to view one's score.
#### Four Corners (Exit Game)
- Four Corners pits up to four teams against each other in a game of combat chance.
- A large room is split into fourths by a waist-high wall. A pack of dogs is released into one corner, who gather together and continue around the square at random. With the pack of hounds as a fifth team, the game continues until one team stands.
### Detail
#### Home Team Red Rover
- See [[#Red Rover (Entrance Game)]]
#### Spear Hall
- A hallway flanked by viewports & spear-holes. Either set to manual operation for the joy of the Kobolds or automatic for the operation of unremarkable rooms.
- On occasion, one end of the hall does not continue into the Hells further, forcing an adventurer who once passed the spears to do so again.
- Spears extend once per round. A character who fails on a DC 15 Dex Save takes 2d8 + 1 piecing damage.
#### Sprinting Boulder
- A long, decending, curved hall with a boulder at the top end. While it begins slowly, it quickly picks up speed.
- Most often, the Sprinting Boulder forces Kailkeep's inhabitants back the way they have come from, forcing them through sections they have been through before.
#### Dart Halls
- A "minefield"-esq game, the Dart Halls are a series of pressure plates and dart throwers. There is a safe path through the field, though it is typically unmarked.
- When a pressure plate is activated, the entire hall is activated. For thirty seconds, each port in the wall fires a dart every three seconds - offset on timing with the surrounding throwers in an attempt to provide consistent suppressing fire. 
- A character may attempt to dodge their way through the darts, and to do so, must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity Saving Throw per ten feet they move, or they will be hit by the darts. The tips of these darts are rusted and diseased. If a character is hit by these darts, they take 3d4 piercing damage. If they took any piercing damage from the darts, they must make a DC 18 Constitution Saving Throw or they will contract *Minor Tetanus*, and after 8 hours, they will become Poisoned for 72 hours.
#### Stone Gas
- A chamber of statues in horrible pained expressions - these were once adventurers who fell to this trap.
- When activated, a dense green gas fills the room, creeping across the floor slowly before filling the room after a number of minutes. When a character begins their turn in the gas, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw, or they are Paralyzed. If this is the second time they have failed this check, they become Petrified instead, and join the statues in this room in a terrible death.
#### Bonebuster
- In this chamber there is a stone obelisk with a small hollow cylinder on each side. When a limb is inserted into one of these apertures, it is crushed, and a hatch opens on that side of the obelisk with a prize inside. Typically, this prize is genuine; small enchanted objects, ammunitions, or potions that have little to no downside.
- While crushing a limb, the Bonebuster deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage to the character, and they will have their choice of a *Broken Arm* or a *Broken Leg*. A character with a *Broken Arm* has Disadvantage on Attack Rolls, Strength Saving Throws, and Strength or Dexterity Checks. A character with a *Broken Leg* has Disadvantage on Dexterity Saving Throws, and Strength or Dexterity Checks, and their speed is halved.
#### Beast Barracks
- This chamber is one of many beast homes within the mountains of Kailkeep. Somehow, this creature is compensated by the Kobolds of Kailkeep.
- The Barracks hold many lower power creatures that made their home here, and they are modestly housed, but are malnourished and conditioned to attack non-Kobolds on detection.
- Blind Dogs, Mindless Guand, Mountain Cats, and even some Madwalkers are common in the Fourth level of Kailkeep.
#### False Oasis
- A pool of water being fed by the walls of the mountain is the main feature of this room. A poor trap, this water is simply non-potable, and will inflict the Poisoned condition for 36 hours upon consumption if the consumer does not succeed on a DC 18 Con Save.
