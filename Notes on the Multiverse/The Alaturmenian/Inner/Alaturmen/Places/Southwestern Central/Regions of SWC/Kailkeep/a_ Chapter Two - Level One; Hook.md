# Level One: Hook
The first level of Kailkeep is a series of halls and chambers seemingly built in a brutalist and well crafted - "dwarven" - style. Throughout this level, pockets of the weakest Loyalists dwell in relative safety, but doomed to boredom in an endless cycle of production and relocation.

The purpose of this level is to begin to lull any entrants into a false sense of security. The furniture and decorations support the theory that this was once a [[Mountain Hall]] outpost that spread throughout this lone mountain, only for them to lose control of the outpost to a magically potent Kobold clan.

## What Dwells Here?
### Loyalists
The loyalists in the first level are the weakest of them all - the elders, the children, the limbless. Few could survive a direct confrontation, and fewer could create an advantage to strike intruders against. The plan of action for any loyalists is to disengage and retreat to the nearest *Kobolted Door* to report the incident.

When they are not retreating from intruders, they are harvesting lichen and algae from pools of water in the [[#Uncut Tunnels]], hunting rodents and small insects throughout their section, and producing simple arms, armors, and textiles with the tools and supplies given to them by their Kobold keepers at the [[#Workshops]].

### Unusual Rodents
A population of Unusual Rodents has escaped containment and survived the meager hunts of the loyalists.

## Exploring this Place
For a few miles, at the bottom of this great hell, a series of chambers continually produce a varied combination of the following types of rooms.

### Navigation
*Level One* is accessed through an [[#Entrance Hall]], which leads into a [[#Grand Chamber]]. While exploring the interior of *Level One*, an [[#Entrance Hall]] connects one [[#Grand Chamber]] to another.

A [[#Grand Chamber]] leads into four of the other rooms, which connect via the [[#Servant Halls]]. The [[#Servant Halls]] themselves connect to additional adjacent rooms, which in turn, connects the entirety of *Level One*.

*Level One* can be exited by ascending the [[#Main Stairs]], the stairs in the [[#Kitchen]], or by climbing onto the balcony overlooking the [[#Grand Chamber]].

### Detail
#### Entrance Hall
An Entrance Hall is a long hall of ornate, carved-stone walls and columns that is egressed by two sets of double doors made of this same thick red stone. 

Six damaged busts are displayed between the columns, each displaying the now-broken face of a supposed dwarven royal. Below each bust, a plaque has been scratched and defaced into illegibility.

Passing the middle line of an Entrance Hall invokes a hidden rune, alerting the residents of the connecting section of *Level One* to the presence of 'intruders'.

#### Grand Chamber
The Grand Chamber is a large rectangular room egressed by double doors of the [[#Entrance Hall]], and four other single doors at the edges of the room. Each of these single doors lead to one of the other rooms that compose this level.

The Grand Chamber is centered on a large communal table, surrounded by a dozen stone chairs. Opposing the set of double doors, a large stone throne sits at the head of the table. The table is not set.

The Grand Chamber has an open-ceiling. Above the entrance to the Chamber, a seating balcony on *Level Two* looks over the Grand Chamber.

#### Main Stairs
The Main Stairs are an ornate set of curved stairs two-folk wide. At the top landing, a single door - identical to it's twin at the bottom landing - leads into one of the rooms on *Level Two*.

#### Kitchen
The Kitchen is comparably smaller than the [[#Grand Chamber]], although a familiar rectangular shape. A door leads to a hall connecting the Kitchen and the [[#Grand Chamber]]. On the other side of the Kitchen, a door in the wall leads into the [[#Servant Halls]], and a set of stairs lead up to the Kitchen on *Level Two*.

The contents of the kitchen are meager, composed of an oven, an open cauldron, and a thick cabinet filled with cookware and utensils. Food is sometimes stored here in stone vessels, including small amounts of flour, oils, or spice, alongside a significantly larger portion of meat.

#### Workshops
A hallway connects from the [[#Grand Chamber]] to an opposing pair of single doors. Behind each is one of the four following Workshop layouts.

##### Crude Metalworks
The Crude Metalworks is a large workshop. Four crucibles are manually fed raw metals collected from the secure drop-shoot on the wall opposing the door. In the center of the room, surrounded by the crucibles, a table carries dozens of simple casts, shaping tools, and metal products. By the drop-shoot, a single door leads into the [[#Servant Halls]]

A stone cart is somewhere within this room, having been used by Loyalist Workers to transport materials from the shoot to the crucibles. 

##### Fine Metalworks
The Fine Metalworks is a small workshop. A large stone forge occupies half of the room opposed to the entrance, paired alongside a large anvil and a grinding wheel.

On one of the other walls, a distance from the forge, a dark black metallic altar adorned with a blue runner and a pair of chalices is used to inspect and export the finished products. As an acceptable item is placed on the altar and the command word is spoken, the chalices begin to bubble over in dark blue smog that moves to cover the item. When the smog dissipates, the item is gone, having been teleported into the armories of the Operators. By the altar, a single door leads into the [[#Servant Halls]]

##### Textiles Mill
The Textiles Mill is a large workshop equipped with two each of a combing system, a spinning wheel, and a weaving rack, all of which are used in tandem to create all manner of textile products, including the clothing, beddings, curtains, and ropes that would appear in some rooms of the Hells above.

Opposed in placement, a drop-shoot in the wall and an altar (both described above) flank the main working space of this room.

##### Leatherworks
The Leatherworks is a small workshop. 

#### Servant Quarters
#### Servant Halls
#### Uncut Tunnels
