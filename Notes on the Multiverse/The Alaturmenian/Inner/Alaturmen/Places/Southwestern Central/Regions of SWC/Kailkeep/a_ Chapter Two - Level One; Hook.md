# Level One: Hook
The first level of Kailkeep is a series of halls and chambers seemingly built in a brutalist and well crafted - "dwarven" - style. Throughout this level, pockets of the weakest Loyalists dwell in relative safety, but doomed to boredom in an endless cycle of production and relocation.

The purpose of this level is to begin to lull any entrants into a false sense of security. The furniture and decorations support the theory that this was once a [[Mountain Hall]] outpost that spread throughout this lone mountain, only for them to lose control of the outpost to a magically potent Kobold clan.

## What Dwells Here?
### Loyalists
The loyalists in the first level are the weakest of them all - the elders, the children, the limbless. Few could survive a direct confrontation, and fewer could create an advantage to strike intruders against. The plan of action for any loyalists is to disengage and retreat to the nearest *Kobolted Door* to report the incident.

When they are not retreating from intruders, they are harvesting lichen and algae from pools of water, hunting rodents and small insects, and producing simple arms, armors, and textiles with the tools and supplies given to them by their Kobold keepers.

### Unusual Rodents
A population of Unusual Rodents has escaped containment and survived the meager hunts of the loyalists.

## Exploring this Place
For a few miles, at the bottom of this great hell, a series of chambers continually produce a varied combination of the following types of rooms.

### Navigation
### Detail
#### Entrance Hall
The Entrance Hall is a long hall of ornate, carved-stone walls and columns that is egressed by two sets of double doors made of this same thick red stone. 

Six damaged busts are displayed between the columns, each displaying the now-broken face of a supposed dwarven royal. Below each bust, a plaque has been scratched and defaced into illegibility.

#### Grand Chamber
The Grand Chamber is a large rectangular room egressed by double doors of the [[#Entrance Hall]], and four other single doors at the edges of the room. Each of these single doors lead to one of the other rooms that compose this level.

The Grand Chamber is centered on a large communal table, surrounded by a dozen stone chairs. Opposing the set of double doors, a large stone throne sits at the head of the table. The table is not set.

The Grand Chamber has an open-ceiling. Above the entrance to the Chamber, a seating balcony on *Level Two* looks over the Grand Chamber.

#### Kitchen, Bottom
The Kitchen is comparably smaller than the [[#Grand Chamber]], although a familiar rectangular shape. A door leads to a hall connecting the Kitchen and the [[#Grand Chamber]]. On the other side of the Kitchen, a set of stairs lead up to the Kitchen on *Level Two*.

The contents of the kitchen are meager, composed of an oven, an open cauldron, and a thick cabinet filled with cookware and utensils.
