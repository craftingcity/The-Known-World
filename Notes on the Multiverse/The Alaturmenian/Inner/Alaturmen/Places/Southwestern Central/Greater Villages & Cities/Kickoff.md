Since it's discovery in the early 70s, Durandurm has been used in the creation of many industrial and alchemical tools and processes that have bettered the living conditions of some portions of the world, and has been growing in popularity and demand internationally for the integral part it plays in the modern Durandurm firearm.

# Description


The way that the crystal resonates with the Weave creates a direct line into the elemental planes, and artificers have recently ([[Timeline#The Age of Beginning]]) manufactured certain weapons that use this powerful leyline to fire small pellets or bolts over long distances.

Recently, Kickoff has been experiencing many raids that have halted trade to and from [[The Golden City]]. 


## Physicality of the Holding


## Defenses
Kickoff is under the protection of the [[Golden Claws]], although they are far from [[The Golden City]]. Many people carry their own bladed weapons and / or Durandurm weaponry, as these people are quite close to the source.

## Notable Locations
