> A

Bandeer is an agricultural community, primarily, although it is the largest pocket of civilization before one reaches [[Coalition City]] while travelling on the [[Unnamed Yerba-Coalition City Road]]. With a population of ~5000, Bandeer is considered a small city - but it is large enough to have a dozen small criminal organizations.
