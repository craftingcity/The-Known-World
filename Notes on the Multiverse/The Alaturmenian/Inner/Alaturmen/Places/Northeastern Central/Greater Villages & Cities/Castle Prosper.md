# Castle Prosper
#### Keep and County of the King [[Arthur Simonson]]
## Holding of [[Arthur's Knights]] & [[Simonson Clan]]
### Located in [[Arthur's Prairie]], H-M24
## Description
#### Population: 29,608
### "The stone-walled heart of his Empire. A hard-stuck nail in soft wood. Only this nail-heart is made with gold."

The village of Prosper has been around for as long as time has been, or, at least nearly so. The Castle Prosper became only after the liberation from [[Edward Bodaim]] and the beginning of the [[Unification]], and the resulting entity took the village's name; [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

As the village grew and grew around the Castle during the [[Unification]], as more and more people joined [[Arthur Simonson|Artie]]'s righteous cause, plans were formulated and enacted, creating massive stone walls around the now major settlement.

Since the end of the war, the population of Castle Prosper has continued to grow, and people have been forced to settle outside the walls of the city. There is a large disparity between the quality of life of these groups of people. At the gates to the city, guardsfolk of [[Arthur's Knights]] collect a small toll (1sp). Any who cannot pay the toll are welcomed to travel with any caravans or stay outside the walls of the Castle improper. 

Guardsfolk of [[Arthur's Knights]] patrol both the inner- and outer-wall streets regularly, as well as along the walls and in towers throughout the surrounding area. Crime is rarely an issue inside the walls of the city. Many older or injured members of [[Arthur's Knights]] are granted posts inside the walls of the city, when feasible, as a reward for their duty, should they take them would be up to the person.

The major houses of the [[Nobles of Prosper]] have homes inside the city's walls, and many of the minor Houses of the Kingdom do as well, though the land inside the walls is expensive - even to a noble.

### General Public Disposition
The common people of [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] recognize that there is a safety inside the walls of the city that they do not receive, but the stories of [[Arthur Simonson]] shouting orders to the flood of Knights defending the village of Prosper in the days before are still spread with insistent truth, leading most people to accept their place in [[His Greater Plan]].
