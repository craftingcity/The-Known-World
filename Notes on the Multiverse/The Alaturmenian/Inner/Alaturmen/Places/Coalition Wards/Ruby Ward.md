##### The Obra Dinn
The Obra Dinn is an exclusive pleasure lounge sponsored and operated by the [[Slimknives]] of the Combine. The major portions of the business are not exclusive to the members of the Slimknives, but the basement is - allowing contacts to speak privately.

'The Obra Dinn'. A bar and lounge hiding connections and opportunities held exclusively for members of the gang - people like you. Making your way into the Ruby Ward is not difficult, and finding the Obra Dinn is an equal feat. The building is shapely, it's roof being curved like a boat's hull gives it an air of authority and intrigue. As you enter through the doorway, you instinctually feel the brush of a person you cannot see by your side, guarding this place. This invisible force makes no attempt to stop you.

Entering the main room of the Obra Dinn, you see a number of figures lounging about the luxuriously comfortable space, spread across grand seats and couches or gathered at a booths and game tables. A large bar stands across from the entrance to this space, where three very well-dressed bartenders serve alcohol, smokes, and a selection of other pleasures. To the right of the end of the bar, a door stands labeled "Members Only".
