	GME-000 "WORLDBINDINGS"
	Threat Level: ORANGE
	Entry Class: TRINKET SET
	Source: 'The Progenitor' ?;(possibly Tetrimoc or equal)
	Last Known Keeper: see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-000 is stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector across 9 cells - each of which are at least 500' from any other TL-O cells - in a series of identical 10'x8'x1' darksteel closets. In each of these closets is a set of rods on which the GME-000 instance rests. A system of mechanics powered by a crank on the left-facing exterior moves the rods to the corners of the closet, such that the instance is pulled taught into a rectangle.

		GME-000 is a set of 9 loops of iron chain, each of which is assumedly attuned to one of the nine most distant planes of the universe. The Guild controls of 2 of the total 9 instances of GME-000. While the GME-000 instance is not crossed into a lemniscate, a 'figure eight' or 'hourglass' shape, the instance is non-active, and will act as assumed. If the instance is crossed into a lemniscate, it becomes active, and creates a pair of Type-4 Planar Gates of the attuned plane in the circular sections of the leminscate.

		Descriptions of the instances are named GME-000-1 through -9, and are described as follows;
		
		- GME-000-1 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Earth', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-2 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Fire', and when activated will begin to steam and smoke as they heat to a white hot, and display the sight of a brass plated room, decorated as a grand entrance hall for a humanoid creature at least 12' tall, as indicated by the visible doors and distorted magnification of the circlular pairs of the instance. GME-000-2 was delivered to the Guild by 'Marcus, the Partnered' on behalf of Kakurak at Containment Conference 000, alongside it's history with Kakurak's Chosen.

		- GME-000-3 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Air', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-4 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Water', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-5 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Mechanis', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-6 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Abyss', and when activated will emit a dark putrid fog, and display the sight of a huge stone-brick bridge. The fog is toxic, and will cause significant internal damage. GME-000-6 was delivered to the Guild by 'the Hatdroppers' at Containment Conference 000.

		- GME-000-7 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Baator', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-8 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Elysium', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-9 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Limbo', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.
