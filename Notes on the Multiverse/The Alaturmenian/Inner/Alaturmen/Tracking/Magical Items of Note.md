# Magical Items by Era
### Prehistorical c.000AF

###### The Worldbindings
```
	GME-000 "WORLDBINDINGS"
	Threat Level: ORANGE
	Entry Class: TRINKET SET
	Source: 'The Progenitor' (TL-O uncontained unidentified)
	Last Known Keeper: See Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-000 is stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector across 9 cells - each of which are at least 500' from any other TL-O cells, and must change monthly - in a series of identical 10'x8'x1' darksteel closets. In each of these closets is a set of rods on which the GME-000 instance rests. A system of mechanics powered by a crank on the left-facing exterior moves the rods to the corners of the closet, such that the instance is pulled taught into a rectangle.

		GME-000 is a set of 9 identical 16' loops of iron chain, each of which is *assumedly* attuned to one of the nine most distant planes of the universe. The Guild controls of 2 of the total 9 instances of GME-000. While the GME-000 instance is not crossed into a lemniscate, a 'figure eight' or 'hourglass' shape, the instance is non-active, and will act as assumed. If the instance is crossed into a lemniscate, it becomes active, and creates a pair of Type-4 Planar Gates of the attuned plane in the circular sections of the leminscate.

		Descriptions of the instances, named GME-000-1 through -9, are as follows;
		
		- GME-000-1 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Earth', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-2 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Fire', and when activated will begin to steam and smoke as they heat to a white hot, requiring specialized disentanglement. The image visible is of a brass plated room seeming decorated as a grand entrance hall for a humanoid creature at least 12' tall, as indicated by the visible doors and distorted magnification of the circlular pairs of the instance. GME-000-2 was delivered to the Guild by 'Marcus, the Partnered' on behalf of Kakurak at Containment Conference 000, alongside it's history with Kakurak's Chosen.

		- GME-000-3 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Air', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-4 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Water', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-5 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Mechanis', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-6 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Abyss', and when activated will emit a dark putrid fog, and display the sight of a huge stone-brick bridge. The fog is toxic, and will cause significant internal damage. GME-000-6 was delivered to the Guild by 'the Hatdroppers' at Containment Conference 000.

		- GME-000-7 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Baator', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-8 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Elysium', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-9 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Limbo', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		Of the total 40 created, exactly 17 (specifically -2, -3, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12, -14, -16, -22, -23, -28, -34, -37, -38, -39, and -40) have survived to the present day, as a potential concequence of pursuing the path presented by a GME-011 instance is an intense explosion, typically resulting in the death of the user and the destruction of the GME-011 instance. Of these 17, GME-011-2, -3, -8, -9, and -22 are held personally by the members of the Council of Mages.

	Entry Description: GME-010 is a naturally processed metallic material that was first discovered by an adventurer who claims to have survived the 'Hells of Kailkeep', and gathered the GME-010 instance from the horde of Luzikiemal.

		GME-010 is natural gold that has been collected and claimed by an adult dragon, who has taken at least one humanoid life in the defense of their horde. As GME-010 is processed, it exhibits inconsistent elemental attunement and affects. GME-010 has been since used as an alchemical tool to evoke this 'chaos' unto another material or object.

	Threat Level: PURPLE
	Entry Class: TRINKET
	Source: Sarhin Bodaim (TL-G contained, confirmed deceased)
	Last Known Keeper: Killrick Em Glask

	Entry Description: GME-008 is to be stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector in a 6'x2'x1' darksteel container lined with a soft textile. GME-008 is currently uncontained, and is being used by it's current Keeper.

		GME-008 is a dual-headed greataxe primarily composed of steel. Together, the heads of the axe are 1.45' across, and they each have a blade just over 14" long. In addition to its material proporties, GME-008 exhibits an emotional influence on its user, creating or increasing irritation and or anger that leads to a murderous rage. Investigation into this property has concluded that this 'rage' is continually and exponentially increasing, but is seriously quelled by its user causing the death of an intelligent humanoid experiencing fear of the user or GME-008 itself.

		GME-008 was crafted by the late Sarhin Bodaim while under the service of her patriarch, Edward Bodaim, who used GME-008 during his rule of the Greenhilles and the surrounding holdings. Since its creation, GME-008 has passed through an unknown number of hands before it was taken off the corpse of its previous Keeper by Killrick Em Glask, who now actively wields GME-008.

	Threat Level: BLUE
	Entry Class: MATERIAL
	Source: Frin Copperhammer (TL-W contained, confirmed desceased)
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-006 is a naturally occuring metallic material discovered first by a group of miners in Mountain Hall's 3rd Mining Colony, but Frin Copperhammer is individually recognized for the popularization of its military applications.

		GME-006 is a 'baby blue' colored metallic material that exhibits atypical structual solidarity and hardness. GME-006 has no known 'melting point', information gathered from reliable sources and internal testing has led to the belief that GME-006 in fact has no 'melting point' and is a wholly solid material. While this presents theoretical manufacturing issues, the products formed of or with this material benefit from this property, typically failing to bend, break, or blunt in even the most stressful scenarios.

	Threat Level: PURPLE
	Entry Class: MATERIAL
	Source: Frin Copperhammer (TL-W contained, confirmed desceased)
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-007 is a naturally occuring gemstone material discovered first by a group of miners in Mountain Hall's 4th Mining Colony, the area now known as Kickoff, but Frin Copperhammer is individually recognized for the popularization of its military applications.

		GME-007 is a multi-staging bright white colored gemstone material that exhibits atypical attunement to Weave influencing effects. When extracted from a source, GME-007 is in it's 'seeking' stage. When exposed to concentrated elements, GME-007 attune to the relevant element, changing color to relfect it's attunement and begin to emit or exhibit affects related to that element (see Test Report 007-1 through -4). This is known as the 'attuned' phase. While GME-007 is 'attuned', it will continue to exhibit it's 'attuned' affects for a period of time relative to the size of the GME-007 instance and the concentration of it's 'attuned' elements. 
		
		After this period, GME-007 enters its 'inert' phase, and will cease to exhibit 'attuned' affects and will slowly begin to dull into a light grey. GME-007 that is 'inert' can be recycled and reprocessed into another instance in the 'seeking' phase.

	GME-004 "RING OF THE UNDYING KING"
	Threat Level: RED
	Entry Class: TRINKET
	Source: Tianna Moore (TL-B uncontained, confirmed deceased)
	Last Known Keeper: Arthur Simonson

	Entry Description: GME-004 is to be stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector in a 1-inch square soft textile bag, which then is to be stored in a 1'x'1'x1' darksteel cube-box lined with a soft textile. GME-004 is currently uncontained, and is being used by it's current Keeper.

		GME-004 is a thick ring of gold with a Draconic phrase enscribed on its outer face. While worn, GME-004 is rendered imperceptable to non-arcane perceptions, and imbues its user with a self-sustainance beyond mortality; the user will not experience age, thirst, or hunger, their wounds will quickly heal, and the user will always deny GME-004's presence and existence.

		GME-004 is the final creation of Tianna Moore before her very public suicide. In the era of the Bandit Lords, GME-004 traded hands between high-level commanders and soldiers before it was claimed by Arthur Simonson during the Battle for Magius c.054AF. Information in this Entry has been gathered via non-invasive divination, and may be incomplete, misinformed, or wholly deceitful.

		GME-005 is a straight-blade mithril longsword. The blade is just over 4' long seemingly becomes sharper as it is used - rather than duller. In addition to its material properties, GME-005 exhibits an emotional influence on its user, creating or increasing a sense of communal justice - a passion for the good of people.

		GME-005 was crafted sometime before the beginning of the Unification Wars, c.056AF, and has been held by King Arthur Simonson since it's creation. Information in this Entry has been gathered via non-invasive divination, and may be incomplete, misinformed, or wholly deceitful.

	GME-003 "ATLAS OF YAMISCH"
	Threat Level: WHITE
	Entry Class: TRINKET
	Source: Yamisch (divine)
	Last Known Keeper: Quartermaster, Vault 0.

	Entry Description: GME-003 is stored within Vault 0's Cold Storage sector, in Lounge 3's open bookshelf.

		GME-003 is a large atlas bound in a furred green hide containing over a thousand pages, each of which is recently created map of a given six-square-mile area. The maps generated by GME-003 will slowly re-generate on a page over the course of 36 hours. If the map-area is unchanged over this period, the image remains unchanged. If the map-area changed, the image will be equally disrupted in those areas that have been changed. Significant constructions or foot-traffic in a map-area will likely present as a blotch of color on the map-image, preventing the use of GME-003 in immediate information gathering, as for military application.

		GME-003 was delivered to a Guild Representative while they were participating in paid-leave by a sickly human man who would become identified as a member of the Cult of Sight. The man exchanged no words with the Representative. During their debriefing interview, the Representative stated: "The man walked by me and dropped the book. I tried to get his attention and give it back, but he kept walking away. Didn't look like he was missing it, I guess, so I opened it up and was immediately overwhelmed. Either art or magic, neither of which are my forte."

	Threat Level: RED
	Entry Class: TRINKET
	Source: The Old Man (TL-O uncontained, assumed deceased)
	Last Known Keeper: Jerran, of the Hatdroppers

	Entry Description: GME-001 is to be stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector in a 1'x'1'x1' darksteel cube-box lined with a soft textile. GME-001 is currently uncontained, and being used as a extraplanar base of operations by Jerran, of the Hatdroppers. Information suggests his current pattern of use is an effective method of meta-containment, and he is located somewhere in the eastern Illburn Forest.

		GME-001 is a small brown leather bag sporting hempen sewing at its points of contact and a bronze buckle upon its center. While the buckle is tied, and the flap of the bag is closed, GME-001 is non-active. Undoing the buckle and opening the flap of the bag will form a Type-2 Planar Gate in the bag, containing an unknown number of door-handles of different shapes and sizes, GME-001-X. When pulled or pushed to open, a GME-001-X will act as its own Type-2 Planar Gate, pointed at a particular Consistent Extraplanar Instance. Once GME-001-X has been activated, GME-001 ceases to physically exist until that GME-001-X is activated again. This particular feature of GME-001 presents the hazardous possibility of any number of users being left stranded in GME-001-X CEIs where they cannot naturally survive.

		GME-001 has been, to our knowledge, the host of exactly two adventuring parties to date, those being first the Grey Ordeal, and second the Hatdroppers. In both the parties' time with GME-001, they have made additions to the assosiated CEIs in such a manner that they together act as a mobile base of operations, including a barracks, a kitchen, a storage room, a garden, an alchemistry labratory, a tinker's workshop, a prison, and a spa.
