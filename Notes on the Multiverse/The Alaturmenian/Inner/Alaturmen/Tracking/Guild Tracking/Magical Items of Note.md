	GME-000 "WORLDBINDINGS"
	Threat Level: ORANGE
	Entry Class: TRINKET SET
	Source: 'The Progenitor' (TL-O uncontained unidentified)
	Last Known Keeper: Quartermaster, Vault 0

	Entry Description: GME-000 is stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector across 9 cells - each of which are at least 500' from any other TL-O cells, and must change monthly - in a series of identical 10'x8'x1' darksteel closets. In each of these closets is a set of rods on which the GME-000 instance rests. A system of mechanics powered by a crank on the left-facing exterior moves the rods to the corners of the closet, such that the instance is pulled taught into a rectangle.

		GME-000 is a set of 9 identical 16' loops of iron chain, each of which is *assumedly* attuned to one of the nine most distant planes of the universe. The Guild controls of 2 of the total 9 instances of GME-000. While the GME-000 instance is not crossed into a lemniscate, a 'figure eight' or 'hourglass' shape, the instance is non-active, and will act as assumed. If the instance is crossed into a lemniscate, it becomes active, and creates a pair of Type-4 Planar Gates of the attuned plane in the circular sections of the leminscate.

		Descriptions of the instances, named GME-000-1 through -9, are as follows;
		
		- GME-000-1 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Earth', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-2 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Fire', and when activated will begin to steam and smoke as they heat to a white hot, requiring specialized disentanglement. The image visible is of a brass plated room seeming decorated as a grand entrance hall for a humanoid creature at least 12' tall, as indicated by the visible doors and distorted magnification of the circlular pairs of the instance. GME-000-2 was delivered to the Guild by 'Marcus, the Partnered' on behalf of Kakurak at Containment Conference 000, alongside it's history with Kakurak's Chosen.

		- GME-000-3 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Air', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-4 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Plane of Water', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-5 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Mechanis', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-6 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'The Abyss', and when activated will emit a dark putrid fog, and display the sight of a huge stone-brick bridge. The fog is toxic, and will cause significant internal damage. GME-000-6 was delivered to the Guild by 'the Hatdroppers' at Containment Conference 000.

		- GME-000-7 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Baator', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-8 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Elysium', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

		- GME-000-9 is an identical instance to the others, excepting it is attuned to 'Limbo', and when activated will have a series of effects, which are currently unknown. This instance is currently undiscovered.

	GME-013 "GROWTH-HEART"
	Threat Level: WHITE
	Entry Class: KNACK
	Source: 'The Progenitor' ?;(possibly Tetrimoc or equal)
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-013 is, at the time of record, an uncontained non-threat, located at ///REDACTED///, an area in the relative south-east of the Extraplane: Underdark, though the precise location is constantly changing.

	GME-013 is a large glowing cyan-blue gemstone estimated to be roughly 36' in diameter, though its current location prevents acurrate measurement. GME-013 actively and consistently emits a field of organically attractive material, since identified as diffused Earth Essance, which aggresively encourages growth of local flora and provides the resources necessary to do so.

	During the course of experimentation, GME-013 displayed signs of agression and intelligence by promoting the growth of flora nearby personnel investigating GME-013 in an attempt to entangle and trap them, which has reduced the number of accurate experiments that can be performed.

	GME-012 "DRAGONFANG DAGGER"
	Threat Level: PURPLE
	Entry Class: TRINKET SET
	Source: Ty'kyta (TL-G contained, confimed deceased)
	Last Known Keeper: Quartermaster, Vault 0

	Entry Description: GME-012 is to be stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector in a 10'x8'x1' darksteel closet that has been fitted with six equidistant pairs of display rods. Each GME-012 instance is to be placed in one of these six 'holding spaces' within the closet. No instance of GME-012 has been used in combat at the time of article completion, as the entire set was delivered to a member of the Guild by their direct Source during Containment Conference 001 and immediately contained.

		GME-012 is a set of 6 unique daggers, where each of the instances have their own apperance and properties. Descriptions of the instances, named GME-012-1 through -6, are as follows;

		- GME-012-1 is a traditional wide-blade dagger made of an unknown bone-white metallic material, with a hemp cord wrapped grip. Once per day, when the wielder of this dagger speaks the command word, the blade of GME-012-1 will extend to a total length of 13 inches. After a period of 50-70 minutes, the effect ceases, and the blade of GME-012-1 retracts to its uneffected length.

		- GME-012-2 is a serrated shiv made of an unknown bone-white metallic material and a very simple tang-grooved grip. Once per day, when the wielder of this dagger speaks the command word, GME-012-2 will dematerialize. After exactly 1 minute elapses, or when the command word is spoken again, the wielder dematerializes and immediately rematerializes with GME-012-2 in the space in which GME-012-2 dematerialized.

		- GME-012-3 is a karambit-blade dagger made of an unknown bone-white metallic material, with a tight black silk wrapped grip. Once per day, when the wielder of this dagger speaks the command word, GME-012-3 begins to emit a thick black smoke, which will surround the wielder in a 10' radius, until GME-012-3 ceases to emit the smoke after 30 seconds and it naturally dissapates. Extensive testing has revealed that this smoke is transparent to the wielder, and has no effect on range of vision or fine motor skills.  

		- GME-012-4 is a diamond-shaped dagger made of an unknown bone-white metallic material and a long wrapped tang, acting as the grip, that has an open circle of this metal as its pommel. Once per day, when the wielder of this dagger speaks the command word, GME-012-4 emits a momentary violent sonic wave from the point of GME-012-4. Entities with audio-reception capabilities who are within a 15' cone originating from GME-012-4 suffer severe damage to the relevant organs.

		- GME-012-5 is a traditional wide-blade dagger made of an unknown bone-white metallic material with a leather-wrapped grip and a small pyramidic pommel. Once per day, when the wielder of this dagger speaks the command word, the blade of GME-012-5 begins to vibrate without causing damage to the form or discomfort to the user. The effect ceases after 3 minutes and 16 seconds.

		- GME-012-6 is a thin stilletto dagger made of an unknown bone-white metallic material with an offensive pointed guard, and a leather-wrapped grip. Once per day, when the wielder of this dagger speaks the command word, the blade of GME-012-6 quickly becomes covered in a stinking green liquid that has since been identified as 'Black Dragon Bile'.

	GME-011 "BLOODRITE TOMES"
	Threat Level: BLUE
	Entry Class: TRINKET SET
	Source: Malkain (TL-G contained, confimed deceased)
	Last Known Keeper: Quartermaster, Vault 0.

	Entry Description: GME-011 is stored within Vault 0's Cold Storage sector, in Lounge 1's locked bookshelves.

		GME-011 is a set of identical grimoires, GME-011-1 through GME-011-40, each of which are bound in a once white, now brown, bloodstained leather. The title and contents of the grimoires are written in Draconic, and then again in Arthurian. GME-011 is a complex manual that describes many arcane concepts, rules, and processes that overall describes a relationship and access to significant arcane ability.

		Of the total 40 created, exactly 17 (specifically -2, -3, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12, -14, -16, -22, -23, -28, -34, -37, -38, -39, and -40) have survived to the present day, as a potential concequence of pursuing the path presented by a GME-011 instance is an intense explosion, typically resulting in the death of the user and the destruction of the GME-011 instance. 
		
		Of these 17, GME-011-2, -3, -8, -9, and -22 are held personally by the members of the Council of Mages. GME-011-16 was held erroneously in the Demonology section of the Center of Arcane Education, and was stolen by the pair of Saoirse and Nikolai in the spring of 105AF.

	GME-010 "CHAOTIC GOLD"
	Threat Level: PURPLE
	Entry Class: MATERIAL
	Source: Luzikiemal (TL-P uncontained, unconfirmed undead/undying)
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-010 is a naturally processed metallic material that was first discovered by an adventurer who claims to have survived the 'Hells of Kailkeep', and gathered the GME-010 instance from the horde of Luzikiemal.

		GME-010 is natural gold that has been collected and claimed by an adult dragon, who has taken at least one humanoid life in the defense of their horde. As GME-010 is processed, it exhibits inconsistent elemental attunement and affects. GME-010 has been since used as an alchemical tool to evoke this 'chaos' unto another material or object.

```
	GME-014 "GLIMMERING MOONBOW"
	Threat Level: PURPLE
	Entry Class: TRINKET
	Source: Unknown
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-014 are to be stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector in a series of 6'x3'x1' darksteel containers, each of which is lined with a soft textile. GME-014 are, at the time, largely uncontained and unused. Although the total number of GME-014 instances is unknown, informed estimates suggest less than 100 instances have been created.
	
		GME-014 is a set of identical longbows made of a curve of blue-tinted ivory roughly 5-feet long, and strung with a thread of Elvenibre. In addition to their material proporties, when the wielder of a GME-014 instance speaks the command word, GME-014 creates an arrow-like projectile of white light in the firing position. This projectile slowly disipates after roughly a minute under bright light, or longer under less light.

	Instances of GME-014 were first rediscovered when a recovered first-elven weapon master's journal was partially restored, describing the use of the weapon by a prestigious class of warriors in a ritualistic ceremony that would replecate the weapon. The major details of the ritual were not recorded in the recovered text. Additional contextual evidence gathered by cooperative agents of Cenva Minyo suggests that, at the time of record, at least three GME-014 instances have been recovered and sold to auction, of which one, GME-014-1, is currently being held by one Jerran Stormwind of The Hatdroppers (see GME-001).

	Entry Description: GME-009 is a crafted alchemical material that has been seen to be created in areas of significant population of Faefolk.

		GME-009 is a glimmering gold-green colored fabric with a texture similar to silk. While GME-009 is very light-weight and flexible, it has a similar material hardness as a strong metal, such as cast-iron or steel.

###### Dawnblade
```
	GME-015 "DAWNBLADE"
	Threat Level: PURPLE
	Entry Class: TRINKET
	Source: Unknown
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-015 are to be stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector in a series of 6'x3'x1' darksteel containers, each of which is lined with a soft textile. GME-014 are, at the time, largely uncontained and unused. Although the total number of GME-015 instances is unknown, informed estimates suggest less than 100 instances have been created.

	GME-015 is a set of identical shortswords made of a yellow-tinted ivory. Their guards are beautifully carved with imagery of a rising sun and clound-layer, and their grips are wrapped in Elvenfibre. In addition to their material proporties, once a day, when the wielder of a GME-015 instance speaks the command word, GME-015 emits a shining white light from the center of it's blade that reaches exactly 35', and no further. The effect ends after 1 minute. If a creature that the wielder considers an ally is harmed within the light, the brightness intensifies, and the wound immediately begins to recover.

	Instances of GME-015 were first rediscovered when a recovered first-elven weapon master's journal was partially restored, describing the use of the weapon by a prestigious class of warriors in a ritualistic ceremony that would replecate the weapon. The major details of the ritual were not recorded in the recovered text. Additional contextual evidence gathered by cooperative agents of Cenva Minyo suggests that, at the time of record, no GME-015 instances have been recovered.

	GME-XXX "RADIATION"
	Threat Level: ORANGE
	Entry Class: SIGNAL
	Source: Syther ben Yarom, Architect
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description

	Entry Description: GME-XXX is, at the time of record, uncontainable, ~~but stable~~ and unstable. GME-XXX is located within the Church of Flame's Minyostalma Blockade and Exclusion District (MBED).

	GME-XXX is a material infection that is particularly potent against ferrous metallics. Over time, an object or material infected with GME-XXX will emit an aura within which the infection will spread across subjects in the area. When the infected material is moved, so too will the aura. For unknown reasons, the Fabric of the Weave becomes loosened in this aura, which can hamper or outright prevent manipulation of the Weave via spellcasting or enchantment within the area.

	The emmition of the aura is blocked in both transmittion and reception by the presence of lead or darksteel, which should be investigated further for the purposes of reducing the major personnel losses experienced during experimentation and analysis of GME-XXX and related entries.

	GME-XXX "FAE-RUN RADIOTHERMAL GENERATOR"
	Threat Level: ORANGE
	Entry Class: KNACK
	Source: Syther ben Yarom, Architect
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-XXX is to be stored within Vault 1's Warm Storage Sector at least 500' away from any other TL-O cells in a 20'x30'x15' lead storage container which itself is stored with a 30'x40'x20' darksteel storage container. This cell is to be stationed by a rotating 2-hour guard of at least 2 personnel at a time. Stationed personnel may spend participate in no more than 3 shifts in a 24-hour period.

	GME-XXX is a complicated system of mythril tanks, pressigen tubes, and lead casings that - when properly fueled by a mixture of water and oil cycling through the tanks and ///REDACTED/// within the casings - produces a heat consistent with Alchemical Thermite for as long as GME-XXX remains fueled.

	As a result of experiments conducted with GME-XXX, potential means of translating this heat into labor have been discovered, and are described in more detail alongside relavent diagrams and schematics in Experiment Log XXX-3 through -22.

	GME-XXX "PURPLE DISTRICT"
	Threat Level: WHITE
	Entry Class: SIGNAL
	Source: Syther ben Yarom, Architect
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: GME-XXX is, at the time of record, uncontainable, but stable. GME-XXX is located within the Church of Flame's Minyostalma Blockade and Exclusion District (MBED). 

	GME-XXX is an immaterial field that translates incredibly minor changes within a very specific section of the Fabric of the Weave, known as 'Purple District', into tangeble physical changes in certain objects or beings within the area that are susceptable to this effect. Expeditions into the MBED have produced additional objects of interest (GME-XXX-1) that are reliably susceptable to GME-XXX effects, known as 'Purple District Actors' or 'PDAs'. These objects are used frequently by the population of the MBED to display, transmit, or modify the information presented by the device via interaction with GME-XXX.

	GME-017 is a thin gold-link necklace roughly 2' in length. While worn, the wearer is highly suceptable to suggestion, and will wholeheartedly attempt to follow through on this suggestion even after GME-017 has been removed, even when a given suggestion conflicts with the wearer's morals, goals, or bodily health.

	GME-017 was most recently seen in the possession of Cassandra Arstovich in the late 70s, but since her disappearance around that time, GME-017 has not been located or reported. Information in this Entry has been gathered via non-invasive divination, and may be incomplete, misinformed, or wholly deceitful.

	GME-019 is a porportional mask made of white ivory and carved to resemble a comically distraught jester. GME-019 is worn by placing the black leather band around your head such that you can see through the eyes of GME-019.

	GME-019 was created by Tiana Moore for her personal use during combat. Since her demise at the hand of Arthur Simonson, GME-019 has been passed around by dozens of merchants, collectors, and adventurers before it was eventually acquired by a group of Slimknives and returned to the Obraa Dinn, where it has since remained.

		GME-008 is a dual-headed greataxe primarily composed of steel. Together, the heads of the axe are 1.45' across, and they each have a blade just over 14" long. In addition to its material proporties, GME-008 exhibits an emotional influence on its user, creating or increasing irritation and or anger that leads to a murderous rage. Investigation into this property has concluded that this 'rage' is continually and exponentially increasing, but is seriously quelled by its user causing the death of an intelligent humanoid experiencing fear of the user or GME-008 itself.

		GME-008 was crafted by the late Sarhin Bodaim while under the service of her patriarch, Edward Bodaim, who used GME-008 during his rule of the Greenhilles and the surrounding holdings. Since its creation, GME-008 has passed through an unknown number of hands before it was taken off the corpse of its previous Keeper by Killrick Em Glask, who now actively wields GME-008.

	Entry Description: GME-020 is stored within Vault 2's Warm Storage sector in a 5'x1'x1' darksteel container lined with a soft textile and fit with ten equidistant display rods on which each GME-020 instance rests. 

	GME-020 is a set of 10 identical 11" gold chain-loops that lack unique or identifying text or markings. The Guild controls all 10 GME-020 instances. While worn, the GME-020 instance will slowly shrink at a constant rate. Experimentation has revealed this rate of shrinkage to be three-tenths of a centimeter per hour. As the GME-020 instance continues to shrink, it will eventually burrow itself into the flesh of it's wearer, and eventually cut through muscle and bone. When a GME-020 instance is removed from its wearer, typically as it falls off once a limb is dismembered, it returns to its typical size.

	GME-020 was created in the late 50s - at the height of the Bandit Lord's reign, and just before their fall - and have been used only twice, disregarding experimentations; the first was used in a pair, named GME-020-1 and -2 respectively, in the dismemberment of Syr Saxon's left arm and right leg, which resulted in his death via exsanguination, and the second was used alone, named GME-020-3, in the beheading of Jacqi Simonson, immediately resulting in her death. All 10 GME-020 instances were recovered by Arthur Simonson during the Unification of Prosper, and were kept in the Chapter House Constantia before they were eventually moved into their current location.

		GME-006 is a 'baby blue' colored metallic material that exhibits atypical structual solidarity and hardness. GME-006 has no known 'melting point', information gathered from reliable sources and internal testing has led to the belief that GME-006 in fact has no 'melting point' and is a wholly solid material. While this presents theoretical manufacturing issues, the products formed of or with this material benefit from this property, typically failing to bend, break, or blunt in even the most stressful scenarios.

When exposed to concentrated elements, GME-007 attune to the relevant element, changing color to relfect it's attunement and begin to emit or exhibit affects related to that element (see Experiment Log 007-1 through -4). This is known as the 'attuned' phase. While GME-007 is 'attuned', it will continue to exhibit it's 'attuned' affects for a period of time relative to the size of the GME-007 instance and the concentration of it's 'attuned' elements. 
		
		After this period, GME-007 enters its 'inert' phase, and will cease to exhibit 'attuned' affects and will slowly begin to dull into a light grey. GME-007 that is 'inert' can be recycled and reprocessed into another instance in the 'seeking' phase.

	Threat Level: RED
	Entry Class: TRINKET
	Source: Tianna Moore (TL-B uncontained, confirmed deceased)
	Last Known Keeper: Arthur Simonson

	Entry Description: GME-004 is to be stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector in a 1-inch square soft textile bag, which then is to be stored in a 1'x'1'x1' darksteel cube-box lined with a soft textile. GME-004 is, at the time of record, uncontained and being used by it's current Keeper.

		GME-004 is a thick ring of gold with a Draconic phrase enscribed on its outer face. While worn, GME-004 is rendered imperceptable to non-arcane perceptions, and imbues its user with a self-sustainance beyond mortality; the user will not experience age, thirst, or hunger, their wounds will quickly heal, and the user will always deny GME-004's presence and existence.

		GME-004 is the final creation of Tianna Moore before her very public suicide. In the era of the Bandit Lords, GME-004 traded hands between high-level commanders and soldiers before it was claimed by Arthur Simonson during the Battle for Magius c.054AF.

	Last Known Keeper: Quartermaster, Vault 0.

	Entry Description: GME-003 is stored within Vault 0's Cold Storage sector, in Lounge 3's open bookshelf.

		GME-003 is a large atlas bound in a furred green hide containing over a thousand pages, each of which is recently created map of a given six-square-mile area. The maps generated by GME-003 will slowly re-generate on a page over the course of 36 hours. If the map-area is unchanged over this period, the image remains unchanged. If the map-area changed, the image will be equally disrupted in those areas that have been changed. Significant constructions or foot-traffic in a map-area will likely present as a blotch of color on the map-image, preventing the use of GME-003 in immediate information gathering, as for military application.

		GME-003 was delivered to a Guild Representative while they were participating in paid-leave by a sickly human man who would become identified as a member of the Cult of Sight. The man exchanged no words with the Representative. During their debriefing interview, the Representative stated: "The man walked by me and dropped the book. I tried to get his attention and give it back, but he kept walking away. Didn't look like he was missing it, I guess, so I opened it up and was immediately overwhelmed. Either art or magic, neither of which are my forte."

	Threat Level: RED
	Entry Class: TRINKET
	Source: The Old Man (TL-O uncontained, assumed deceased)
	Last Known Keeper: Jerran, of the Hatdroppers

	Entry Description: GME-001 is to be stored within Vault 0's Warm Storage sector in a 1'x'1'x1' darksteel cube-box lined with a soft textile. GME-001 is, at the time of record, uncontained and being used as a extraplanar base of operations by its current Keeper. Information suggests his current pattern of use is an effective method of meta-containment, and he is located somewhere in the eastern Illburn Forest.

		GME-001 is a small brown leather bag sporting hempen sewing at its points of contact and a bronze buckle upon its center. While the buckle is tied, and the flap of the bag is closed, GME-001 is non-active. Undoing the buckle and opening the flap of the bag will form a Type-2 Planar Gate in the bag, containing an unknown number of door-handles of different shapes and sizes, GME-001-X. When pulled or pushed to open, a GME-001-X will act as its own Type-2 Planar Gate, pointed at a particular Consistent Extraplanar Instance. Once GME-001-X has been activated, GME-001 ceases to physically exist until that GME-001-X is activated again. This particular feature of GME-001 presents the hazardous possibility of any number of users being left stranded in GME-001-X CEIs where they cannot naturally survive.

		GME-001 has been, to our knowledge, the host of exactly two adventuring parties to date, those being first the Grey Ordeal, and second the Hatdroppers. In both the parties' time with GME-001, they have made additions to the assosiated CEIs in such a manner that they together act as a mobile base of operations, including a barracks, a kitchen, a storage room, a garden, an alchemistry labratory, a tinker's workshop, a prison, and a spa.

	Researcher Notes: The modern concpet of extradimensional storage is almost certainly a result of the creation of GME-001 and it's use by legendary adventuring parties, so we can blame the Old Man for all our paperwork.

	Threat Level: PURPLE - ORANGE, see Entry Description.

	Source: Unknown, see GME-001
	Last Known Keeper: None, see Entry Description.

	Entry Description: Instances of GME-049 are to be stored within the Vault 0 Processing sector in a 1'x'1'x1' darksteel cube-box lined with a soft textile labelled appropriately for the class of the instance. After processing, the following procedures are to be followed:
	- GME-049-C1 instances are to be stored within the Vault 0 Warm Storage sector in independent TL-O cells, at least 500' from any other TL-O cells, in their 'original' cube-box.
	- GME-049-C2 instances are to be stored within the Vault 0 Warm Storage sector in one of six TL-R cells (see Procedure Document 049-33), in their 'original' cube-box.
	- GME-049-C3 instances are to be stored within the Vault 0 Warm Storage sector, in their 'original' cube-box.
	- GME-049-C4 instances are to be released to the Guild of Merchants within 3 weeks of their processing.

		GME-049 is a collective identifier for the objects that qualify under the following designation classes:
			- GME-049-C1 are instance objects capable of instantly forming and collapsing a Type-2 Planar Gate pointed at one infinite Consistant Extraplanar Instance at the will of it's wielder.
			- GME-049-C2 are instance objects capable of forming a Type-2 Planar Gate pointed at one infinite Consistant Extraplanar Instance, and capable of manipulating the size of their own Gate Entrance within a radius of 3', extending the physical size of the instance's Gate Entrance. 
			- GME-049-C3 are instance objects capable of forming a Type-2 Planar Gate pointed at one infinite Consistant Extraplanar Instance, and incapable of manipulating the size of their own Gate Entrance.
			- GME-049-C4 are instance objects capable of forming a Type-2 Planar Gate pointed at one finite Consistant Extraplanar Instance, and incapable of manipulating the size of their own Gate Entrance.

		GME-049 instances, and the process and knowledge of their creation, presents an existential threat to physical reality as we know it, and therefore the mission of the Guild of Wizards. Class 1 and Class 2 instances present an immediate tactical threat and should be dealt with accordingly. Class 1 or Class 2 instances, or the knowledge of their creation, must be immediately captured, recovered, or destroyed at all costs.
