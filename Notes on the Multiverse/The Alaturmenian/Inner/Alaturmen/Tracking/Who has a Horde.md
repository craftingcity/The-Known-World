# Who has a Horde?
## And Where?

A 'Horde' is a collection of currency and or items of value that can be attributed to a single person or a non-commercial, non-governmental entity (excluding the Guild's Vaults).

[[Kakurak]] holds a horde at his lair near the [[Firelight Sea]]

[[Alergra Barrowinch]] holds much wealth in business and keeps a modest horde of wealth, but a great horde of magical items both on her person and in her tower in [[Magius]]

The bowels of [[The Old]] hold a horde of ancient elven creations.

So too do the bowels of [[Kailkeep]] hold many magical artifacts, but to sort through the accursed items would be difficult.

[[The Old Man]] knows the location of all the Relics of [[The Grey Ordeal]], though he himself keeps no wealth.
