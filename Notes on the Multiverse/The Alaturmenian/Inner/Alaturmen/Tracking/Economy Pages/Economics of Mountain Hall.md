# Mountain Hall's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
Mountain Hall is a large colony of near-isolationist Mountain Dwarves of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Suremantle]].

### Mushroom
The Bluecap mushrooms cultivated in Mountain Hall make a thick musky flour. Most citizens of Mountain hall use this to thicken their soups and stews, but Blue Bread is formed sometimes, but when compared to other "true grain" bread, is a crumbly mess of stinking powder.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Goats, Chicken, and Wurm are husbanded in Mountain Hall. They are fed moss, insects, squash rinds, and other wastes. Beef, when imported from the north, is a considerably expensive choice.

#### Dairy
Goat's milk and cheese are the locally produced dairy. Eggs, while less potent, are produced on mass by the large chicken farms the Clans own.

#### Grain
Bluecap Mushroom creates a crumbly musky flour. Other grains are imported, but they are considerably expensive compared to Bluecap. Some people of means can consistently eat non-bluecap grains for some time, but this is nearly always unsustainable.

#### Fruit
Avocados and Almonds are grown in massive orchards, but these are the only fruit that grow in this region. Many fruits are imported from the south and the east, but these are made expensive by the King's tariffs.

#### Vegetable
Many types of edible Mushroom are grown in Mountain Hall. Squash and Cabbage too are grown here. Beans act as a rotation crop and are considered acceptable as food for the people. Sometimes other vegetables are imported, but there is little demand for these non-local vegetables.

#### Spice and Oil
Locally, the only available spices and oils are rock salt and avocado oil. Rock salt is mined from Mountain Hall's depths. Avocados are pressed into oil as an industry in this region. 

Otherwise, many Oils and Spices are imported from the south. These are not as heavily tarriffed as fruit, leading to these three items appearing similar in value to the common people.

#### Delicacy
The prime delicacy of Mountain Hall is the chevron-bluecap kabasa. It is often served with beans, squash, and some types of mushroom and is traditionally spiced with salt, pepper, paprika, lavander, and nutmeg.

### Vices
What do people do for *fun*?

Smokebulb is cultivated in great quantity in Mountain Hall, and is a culturally acceptable substance. Blue Whiskey, the alcohol of fermented Bluecap, is also culturally acceptable. Some alcohol is imported from the south and east.

Brothels in Mountain Hall are well maintained, even without the assistance of the [[Guild of Merchants]].

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

The King of [[Mountain Hall]] owns all the land in the [[Dwarven Kingdom Suremantle]] and leases portions of it to each of the Clans. Citizens will often craft their homes and those of their neighbors. 

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

Mountain Hall is ruled by its King. The [[Nobles of Mountain Hall]] are tenants-in-chief of their regions, and maintain a manorial relationship with their citizens. Taxes of one-half mined goods and one-eighth all other goods are collected by employed tax collectors who pass this tax to their lord, who pass this and one fourth their profits to the king, who in turn uses it to fund kingdom projects, passing this money back to the nobles, who in turn pass it back to the people. 

Domesticated Wurm are the most common work animal, and are common companions of miners in this region. Buildings are carved from the stone of the [[Deakred Range]]. 

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

In many instances, the poorest citizens of Mountain Hall suffer from scurvy, leading to a spiral that ends in their death. If one wishes to, say, not die of scurvy, the army of your local Clan is an honest if not safe option that solves many of the issues present in a privatized life in Mountain Hall.

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
