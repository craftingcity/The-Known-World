# Arms Companies
*Arms Companies* are the industrial alchemical and engineering conglomerates responsible for producing the modern weaponry of nations, counties, and other private companies - namely firearms.

Firepowder is the elder of the two materials in the world of firearms, the other being Durandurm, and can be created using minerals like sulphur, where Durandurm has largely only been found in the [[Kickoff]] region of [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]].
