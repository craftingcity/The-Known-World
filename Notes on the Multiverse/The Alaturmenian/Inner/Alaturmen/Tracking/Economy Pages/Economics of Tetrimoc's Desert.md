# Tetrimoc's Desert's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
Tetrimoc's Desert is a lawless and vast desert. Warm during the day, cold during the night â€“ and nearly always very dry.

### Corn
The Desert of Tetrimoc is warm during the day and cold during the night. Maize grows well in these conditions, and consumes most of the nutrients in the sandy soil in this region.

Most people turn this into a basic bread or cake.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
We eat goat if we're in the city, or worms if we're outside. Or people. Y'know, if you have to...

#### Dairy
Goats milk! Some city folk can get imported Cow Cheese, but its rare. So is nuts milk, we just dont get a lot of dairy tbh.

#### Grain
Nearly only corn, some folks can get light grains in the wetter areas, but we get to sell that, so we eat corn.

#### Fruit
Cactus! Oranges, lemons, limes, cherries, berries, bananas, and coconuts.

#### Vegetable
We import cheap mushrooms & potatoes, but we can grow corn, carrots, and sometimes tomatoes.

#### Spice and Oil
Rosemary, Lavender, Oregano,

Olives and Almonds grow on the West bank of the [[Alvalini River]].

#### Delicacy
Chevron & Fruit salad.

### Vices
What do people do for *fun*?

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

Lead, Silver, and Gold can be found in abundance in this area.

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
