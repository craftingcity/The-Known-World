# Coalition City's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
[[Coalition City]] is a metropolis set into a massive mountain range. In general, most items are imported rather than produced. Those foods that are actually produced here are not a part of industrialized processes, rather from small gardens of personal use. In effect, the food of the people are their coin.

### "Bread"
Bread plays it's role in Coalition City, and given it's importance to trade in the area, Coalition City has access to most other culture's staples. For most folks in the city - the lower to middle classes - Rye is the flour of choice. Flour arrives prepared, and there is no significant space for grain farming, so there is no need for mills within the City.

### Food
#### Meat
Coalition City has no natural bounty of animals for domestication or hunting, nor the space necessary to develop such a bounty, leading its population to import prepared meats or live animals for slaughter. A large majority of this business comes from [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]'s cattle farms, but most any meat could be found somewhere in the city.

#### Dairy
In similar circumstance to its Meats, Coalition City's Dairy is mostly imported from outside its walls. Stable cheese is the most common and cheap form of dairy one can acquire, although milk can be imported at great expense from the north-east, or space can be made for a goat or two.

#### Grain
Rye is cheap, and imported en-mass from [[The Kingdom of Prosper]], making it the staple grain within the city. Potatoes and Maize are imported from the north and east, but these white grains are considered a minor delicacy that is reserved for the upper classes.

#### Fruit
Again, space is a major issue for the farming population of Coalition City. The home-grown fruits of the City are invasive species of vertically proficient and hearty fruits that have proliferated some of the City's Wards, such as the huckleberries growing in the alleys of the Moss Ward. Otherwise, and more commonly, Fruit is imported from the south-east, where it grows in plenty and can be easily transported along the [[Alvalini River]], typically as a processed good rather than the more coveted raw fruits.

#### Vegetable
Mushroom, Cabbage, Carrots, Potatoes, and even Lettuce are imported from nearby producers, but they all fall in the face of the mighty **Bean**. Given the import-based nature of the City's culinary climate, the cheapest and best travelling ingredient, such as the world's favorite rotation crop, Beans have become defaulted into the most common ingredient of Coalition City's food.
