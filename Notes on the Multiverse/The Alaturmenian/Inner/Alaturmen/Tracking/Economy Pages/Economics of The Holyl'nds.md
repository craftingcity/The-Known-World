# Holyl'nd's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The Holyl'nds were once part of a [[Great Northern Forests|large forest]] that has since [[Great Fires|burnt down]]. Now, a wasteland prospers in the shadow of [[Its Greatness|It's]] glorious [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]]. The Holyl'nds experience cold, wet weather patterns.

### "White" Corn
The fine silty soil of this land does not grow any grain other than a type of white maize. This is typically formed into a bread.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Cattle are a valued commodity in the Holyl'nds, both for their production of Dairy product and for their large leathers and meat. The large swaths of un-used land provide much space for ranchers to graze in.

#### Dairy
The largest dairy in this area is cow's milk. Cheese and butter are created from it and spread throughout Alaturmen.

#### Grain
While some grains can be found in import, the only grain that grows in this area is "Great Maize", a white variant of traditional corn / maize. The flavor is blander than its more colored cousin, but beggars cannot be choosers.

#### Fruit
Very few fruits will survive the soil in this area. The two most consumed fruits in this area are avocado and pear, both of which survive in the soil of the Holyl'nds. Solan Berry are cultivated in this area, but their tomato-like fruit grow to be small, grey, and saggy. Heart-nuts are produced as large fruit on small trees in this region, although they are not culturally acceptable as food for a person.

#### Vegetable
Lettuce, Cabbage, and Squash perform well in the soil in this area. Beans are a rotation crop, and it is generally considered animal's food, but certain dishes such as some stews or salads they are essential in.

#### Spice and Oil
While most folk use butter or milk to cook, some professionals make Heart-nut Oil for industrial use. Some Avocado Oil is imported from [[Mountain Hall]], but this is a very expensive alternative.

Lemongrass, Peppercorn, and Lavender are staple spices in this area. Salt is cheaply imported from the south and the east. Ginger, Parsley, Onion, Garlic, and Paprika can be imported from nearby regions for over-value prices, and other spices are exorbitantly expensive here, if available at all.

#### Delicacy
A ration from this place probably includes jerkied, smoked, or salted beef, dried pear, salted butter.

Spiced beef served with fruit, vegetables, and white-corn bread is the commoner's delicacy in this area.

### Vices
People in this area grow and smoke tobacco. Smokebulb, its subsidiaries, and Cannabis are also available substances in this area, but they are imported from other places and therefore more expensive.

Bourbon of white-corn is the drink of choice in the Holyl'nds, although pear ciders are commonly served as well. Rarely, Combine Spirits are available in bars and taverns of this area, and while they are expensive liquors, they are worth the label mark-up.

Like other nations under Coalition, the brothels of the Holyl'nds are protected by the [[Guild of Merchants#Yáramólë]], although they do not need them, the [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]] provides all the protection one could need.

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

[[The Church of the White Flame|The Church]] claims all the Holyl'nds, and grants portions to *Tendered* who can hold it. *Patrons* who collect around them answer to their *Tendered*, who is now responsible for the land their Patrons claim.

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

People expect protection from the Church, but often reach to each-other before their superiors. Some families have a bow and set of arrows, and most have another some sort of home-defense weapon such as a club or sword. Some people have sport-weapons as well, but these are more individual than general.

Much of the "law" of this land is enforced by it's theocratic culture combined with a dominant and pseudo-omnipresent religious figure. Taxes are a mandatory tithe presented to the *Tendered* bi-weekly. While there is no "true" numbered tax, any less than one-third earns one dirty looks and fewer friends. Tendered in turn tithe four-fifth of their total revenue during this two week period to the *Collectors* that come for this tithe.

A farm's work animal is typically a bull that has been trained from birth for the position. A rancher will generally sell young work-bull to farmers rather than a farmer training their own bull. People of means will generally have (either by hire or purchase) Unseen that perform complex labor tasks as well.

Buildings are generally larger than they have to be, and buildings are farther apart than one may consider typical. Most buildings are built of bricks formed from the soil of this area. Often, these are reinforced by large charcoal logs or imported wood.

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

While there is no upward mobility in the Holyl'nds, people can often make ends meet by speaking with their neighbors. When this does not work, this generally means the whole neighborhood is doing poorly, at which point the people will ask for intervention, either from [[The Church of the White Flame|The Church]] or [[Its Greatness|The Holy Flame]].

People value privacy and community. Textiles are a symbol of status, as they are nearly always imported (leather (not imported) < hemp < linen < silk). Gems and precious metals are valued accessories and materials in this areas. 

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

The church mints coins, and cities use them frequently, but folks on the outskirts of civilization are much less happy to trade for round metal. Trade between villages is in barter. Merchants and producers travel to festivals to do trade and form markets by drawn carriage.

The [[Guild of Crafters]] and the [[Guild of Merchants]] are powerful in this region. Most crafting knowledge in this area was lost during the [[Great Fires]], and the people have many unmet needs in this area, both problems the guilds were designed to solve. 

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

The [[Guild of Crafters]] keep their monopoly by maintaining hierarchy positions of knowledge. Nearly all the specialists of this area work in Guild facilities.

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

Leather is not to be worn, except as armor, and hemp is barely acceptable to commoners. Flax is a popular plantation crop; Linen and Silk are the most sought textiles of this region. Dyes from this area are poor, formed of fruit and vegetable matter, and imported dye is extremely expensive. Brown and grey are the two most common colors, the family of blue falling shortly behind, and anything remotely vibrant is considered regal fashion. 

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

Salted beef and cow's butter and cheese are a pantry staple. These are generally wrapped in thin leathers. Corn flour is stored in linen bags. Salted and spiced avocado cream is stored in jars of village-crafted ceramic or glass containers. Solan and Pear jellies are stored in similar containers, some addition to properly seal the container. Vegetables are pickled with fruit vinegar of the region and canned in glass or metal containers.

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

Reusable glass and ceramic containers store many preserved foods. Some people of means can their preserves in metal containers that must be reforged to properly seal again.

People store their personal items in small ceramic boxes or bags of leather, hemp, or linen.

### Mining
Charcoal is the must abundant mine-able in the region sans the holyl'nd itself. Copper, Iron, Coal, and Tin can also be mined in this region - not very abundantly. 

### Magic / Technology
The magic of this region is held in and enforces the theocracy of [[The Church of the White Flame]] and therefore is modulated through [[Its Greatness]]. Commoners experience magic as religion; the crops are shit this year because you made our god made, or, the crops are really good this year because we made our god happy.

The technology of this region is par for the region; wind and manual power is efficiently used to solve common problems. Buildings are built from a medium strength brick, worse than ceramic or concrete, and most "fine" components of a building or machine are built of iron, copper, or bronze.
