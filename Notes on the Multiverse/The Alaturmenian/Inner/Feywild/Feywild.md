# The Plane of Faerie
## History
## Governance
The Feywild is governed by the [[Ceilie Courts]] in "*conjunction*" with the [[Jabbawok]].

### Ceilie Courts
The Ceilie Courts are the four governing bodies of the [[#Four Seasons of the Feywild]], each headed by their Monarch, supported by their Archfey and Princes, and ruling over both the seasonal and non-seasonal fey in their court. Those fey non-seasonal are much less than inclined to participate in Court activity, and often will only comply begrudgingly even when the task at hand is in their best interests. 

### Jabbawok
The [[Jabbawok]] is both an entity and a title, but first, foremost, and most importantly, it is a name - a *powerful* one at that. When [[Jabbawok]] loses this name, they transfer all aspects of being [[Jabbawok]] to the entity who took it.
