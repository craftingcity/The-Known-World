### Air

In general, the Underdark is surprisingly well ventilated. Vast subterranean spaces and the rare planar connection to the

Elemental Plane of Air provide plenty of good air for living creatures. However, this is not universally true.

#### Poor Air

Sealed chambers, isolated caves, and water-isolated caverns have finite supplies of good air. Creatures that don't breathe need not concern themselves with air quality, but other travelers do.

Any enclosed space that is reasonably airtight can quickly become stale or depleted. In general, a Medium creature depletes about 1,000 cubic feet of air (a 10-foot cube) every 6 hours. A Small creature requires one-half as much air, and a Large creature four times as much. Air becomes stale when it is halfway to depletion.

**Stale Air**: Regions that are poorly ventilated are not immediately deadly, but the stale air can quickly wear out even the hardiest travelers. A character in stale air must succeed on a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or become fatigued. A fatigued character must succeed on a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or become exhausted. An exhausted character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15 minutes until the condition is corrected. Characters cannot recover from their fatigue or exhaustion until they reach an area of good air.

**Depleted Air**: Depleted areas can prove deadly in a matter of minutes. See Slow Suffocation, page 304, DMG.

#### Gases and Fumes

Some areas of the Underdark are plagued by air that is not just stale, but actively toxic. Often this situation results from geothermal activity in the vicinity of volcanoes. Sometimes the escaping gases emerge with an audible hiss or a putrid smell, but not always.

Gases tend to concentrate in areas that are isolated in some way from the nearby passages. For example, a passage that dips down sharply and then climbs up again forms a natural, low-lying pocket where deadly fumes can accumulate. An-air-filled passage sealed by water siphons at either end could also concentrate deadly gases.

**Irritating Fumes**: These gases cause coughing, stinging of the eyes, dizziness, and similar difficulties. A character exposed to irritating fumes must succeed on a Con save once per minute (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or become *Poisoned*. Recovery from this condition is not possible until the character leaves the affected area.

**Poison Gas**: These gases are deadly. Anyone who ventures into an area of poison gas must succeed on a Con save once per minute (DC 13, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage {yikes!}.

Some poisonous gases also have the characteristics of irritating fumes, so their presence is obvious. Others, however, offer no telltale burning of the throat or stinging in the eyes to warn creatures of the danger. Any creature exposed to poison gas is entitled to a DC 15 Survival check to detect the threat before breathing enough to force a saving throw. With a successful check, the creature can retreat before risking any damage. A creature with the scent ability gains a +5 bonus on this check.

**Explosive Gas**: Some naturally occurring gases can explode in the presence of open flames. If a burning torch or lit lantern is brought into a pocket of explosive gas, the vapor explodes, dealing 3d6 points of damage to each creature in a 10-foot radius (Reflex DC 15 half). An alert spelunker might notice the danger before causing an explosion, since the open flame often behaves strangely (burning in a different color or exceptionally brightly) right before the explosion. Allow the creature carrying the light a DC 20 Survival check to observe the danger before the explosion actually occurs. If an open flame remains in the hazardous area thereafter, there is a 50% chance of an explosion in each subsequent round.
