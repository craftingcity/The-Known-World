## Light

Except for any lanterns that characters bring into the caves, the Underdark is absolutely dark. Coupled with the tomblike silence of most passages, absolute darkness can unnerve even the most experienced caver. Thus, extra lights and oil (or magical means of illumination) are important for any cave trip.

### Artificial Illumination

Halflings, humans, and other surface dwellers without darkvision must absolutely carry some form of light with them in order to navigate the Underdark. While torches or lanterns are feasible for relatively short trips, a journey of more than a few days might require dozens of torches and oil flasks, making non-magical light impractical for long expeditions.

The best and most efficient means of providing light in the Underdark is to use alchemical or magical items.

### Natural Illumination

While most of the Underdark is exactly that, some locales possess sources of natural illumination.

**Luminescent Growths**: Rare forms of lichen, fungi, and moss are bioluminescent. In sufficient quantities, these growths can illuminate large caverns. Most bioluminescent growths are quite dim, so a cavern illuminated by glowing moss or fungi is typically as dark as starlight, although some particularly bright regions might be equal to moonlight.

**Molten Rock**: Areas with exposed pools or streams of magma are illuminated by the dim, ruddy glow of the molten rock. The glare of molten rock is typically equal to moonlight.

**Radiant Crystal**: Some rare rocks of the Underdark are naturally radiant, ranging in brightness from starlight to full daylight, although daylight equivalence is quite rare. The great vault of [[Deep Imaskar]] is roofed with radiant crystal that is as bright as weak surface daylight.

**Reflective Stone**: While not naturally luminescent, caverns made partially of reflective stone can be much more easily illuminated by small light sources than normal. Reflective stone quadruples the radius of illumination of any light source brought inside.

**Wizard Fire**: The rarest and most wondrous of natural illuminations in the Dug Too Deep, wizard fire consists of dancing sheets of dim light, like the northern lights of the surface world. Though it is only as bright as starlight, wizard fire is weird and beautiful.

## Spotting Distances 
#### in Dim Light
Terrain | Distance*
--- | ---
Water Formed Cave | 2d4 x 10 ft.
Fungal Forest | 3d6 x 10 ft.
Gore or Shaft | 6d6 x 10 ft.
Vault Floor | 6d6 x 10 ft.
Rift, Tunnel, or Abyss | Limit of Sight**
*if a party is carrying bright light, they may be spotted by double this range
**A light source can be seen at a distance of 20 times its radius of illumination

### Seeing Distant Light

Carrying lights can be quite dangerous in the Upperdark. In a large cavern, a torch can be spotted from much farther away than its radius of illumination, which means that any creatures nearby have plenty of time to decide whether to avoid the surface dwellers or lay an ambush for them.

**Complete Darkness**: In general, a light source can be spotted (Spot DC 20) at a distance equal to 20 times its radius of illumination, if the area is otherwise in complete darkness. For example, a sunrod can be seen from 600 feet away, provided that nothing obstructs the line of sight. An observer who fails this Spot check automatically spots the light source at half that distance.

**Dim Light**: In conditions equal to starlight or moonlight, a light source can be spotted (Spot DC 20) at a distance equal to 10 times its radius of illumination. For instance, a sunrod can be seen from, 300 feet away in these conditions. An observer who fails this Spot check automatically spots the light source at half that distance.

**Using Distant Illumination**: Creatures outside the illumination of a light source can see into it just fine. An observer who is close enough to spot the light source automatically (10 times the radius of illumination in complete darkness, or half that in dimlight) can make Spot checks as normal to discern creatures or objects in the illuminated area.
