In the northwest, the [[Howling Warrens]].

To its east, [[Great Abadon Lake]], home of the Ziggurat Kou-toa.

Further, the old human mining colony of [[Heilich-Muwwoq|New Ammyrain]]. The Duergar make their home here, and spread to the south in fewer numbers towards [[Blurkfraggir]].

West of their southern reaches, the settlement of [[Ootool]] is said to have been made by the Illithid, but this sounds unlikely, as noone has seen one come forth from the ruins on which the settlement is built

West-south-west, the Settlement of [[Durgg-Likin]] is a goblin settlement.

West further, the Long River. This connects the Howling warrens and the Troglodyte territory to its south. This territory spans west and south from [[Hraak Azul]].

Northeast of the territory and capital city of troglodytes, the old [[Inverted Tower]] remains untouched, as its wards and traps still take victim.

Northeast still, a large vault contains the Drow city of [[Ungaethram]]. 

To their east, the [[Hunting Grounds]] house a community of young dragons.

South-south-east, a dwarven settlement in Deepburrow. They are of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]].

Far to its south, [[Ootool]] is a fungal city, home to all in the underdark. This is where [[The Whitimores]] fled to after being exiled from [[Ungaethram]].

Centered between the [[Inverted Tower]], [[Forgehome]], and [[Ungaethram]] is the [[Grazing Fields]]. This place is lush with growth, attracting hunter and gatherer alike. This area is fruitful, but very dangerous.

South of the Fields, the [[Fungal Forests]] leeches some of the prosperity that the Fields see.

Slightly northeast is [[Growth Heart]]. A ruin of an old druid's attempts at making the underdark a more comfortable place.

South some, the [[Crystal Sea]] spans far, and to its east, [[Maelbrathyr]] stands at the edge of a wide abyss.
