In the northwest, the [[Howling Warrens]] are a genuine danger, leavimg those who return from there insane, and those who do not to suffer exposure to [[Pandemonium]].

To the east of the Warrens, the [[Great Abadon Lake]] is home of the Ziggurat Kou-toa.

Further east, the old human mining colony of [[Heilich-Muwwoq|New Ammyrain]] lays. The Duergar make their home here, and spread to the south in fewer numbers towards [[Blurkfraggir]].

South of the Warrens, the Settlement of [[Durgg-Likin]] is a less than civilized, being the home to a population of Shallow Men, including ex- humans, goblins, and orc.

West of Durgg-Likin, the Long River connects the Howling warrens and the Kalix territory to the far south. Their territory spans west and south from [[Hraak Azul]].

Northeast of the Kalix territory and their capital city, the old [[Inverted Tower]] remains untouched, as its wards and traps still take victims to this day.

Northeast still, in what could be considered the center of the region, a large vault contains the Drow city of [[Ungaethram]]. 

To their east, the [[Hunting Grounds]] house a community of young dragons.

South-south-east, the settlement of [[Forgehome]] exports metals into the surface. While they are affiliated with the [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]], they are an autonomous entity. 

Far to the south of Forgehome south, [[Ootool]] is a fungal city, home to the wary and lost. 

`This is where [[The Whitimores]] fled to after being exiled from [[Ungaethram]].`

Centered between the [[Inverted Tower]], [[Forgehome]], and [[Ungaethram]] is the [[Grazing Fields]]. This place is lush with growth, attracting hunter and gatherer alike. This area is fruitful, but very dangerous.

Southwest of the Fields, the [[Fungal Forests]] leeches some of the prosperity that the Fields see.

Southeast of the Forests is the [[Growth Heart]]. An organ of a dead titan. Still beating.

South some, the [[Crystal Sea]] spans far, and to its east, [[Maelbrathyr]] stands at the edge of a wide abyss, marking the edge of the region.
