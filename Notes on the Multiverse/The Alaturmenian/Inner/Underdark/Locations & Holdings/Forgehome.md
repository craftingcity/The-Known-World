# Name
#### Sub-names?
## Holding of The Mayorship
### Located in the [[Upper Northwestern Underdark]], X:Y
## Description
### "Quote"

### General Public Disposition

### Background
##### Forgehome
```
The largest dwarven settlement this side of the surface, a mining town, soon to be moved on from. The Mayors (not Kings, as this is an impermanent place) rule this place, and are typically other dwarves. The people of Forgehome still recall the reign of Keldo, the halfling, as a prosperous peace time for the city.

The dwarves of Forgehome have grown rightly suspect of outsiders, and will only allow parties including their dwarven cousins to seek semi-permanent refuge here, although if they are proven trustworthy, the denizens are willing to commit trade. [[Bosi]] runs the "Outlander Exchange" in Forgehome, and is one of the few trusted to engage with outsiders.

Forgehome keeps contact with the nearest dwarven kingdom, and much of the trade flowing from Forgehome goes through there.

The tale of Deepreach is a proud but sad one. The failure of a dwarven kingdom; its riches still lost in the Deep.
