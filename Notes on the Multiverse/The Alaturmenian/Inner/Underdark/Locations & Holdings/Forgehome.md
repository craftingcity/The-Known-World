# Name
#### Sub-names?
## Holding of The Mayorship
### Located in the [[Upper Northwestern Underdark]], X:Y
## Description
### "Quote"

### General Public Disposition
The dwarves of Forgehome have grown rightly suspect of outsiders, and will only allow parties including their dwarven cousins to seek semi-permanent refuge here, although if they are proven trustworthy, the denizens are willing to commit trade. [[Vatox Bosi]] runs the "Outlander Exchange" in Forgehome, and is one of the few establishments trusted to engage with outsiders.

### Background
Forgehome is one of the largest settlements on this side of the surface, and primarily acts as a mining town. Forgehome is an extended outpost of [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]] & the [[Darnt Hillkeep]], although they are an autonomous city-state by law.

When it was created, Forgehome was designed as a temporary settlement that would act in-between the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] or other members of the surface and [[#Deepreach]], though the latter's demise would leave Forgehome to uptake their responsibilities, and become expansive and permanent.

##### Forgehome
```
The largest dwarven settlement this side of the surface, a mining town, soon to be moved on from. The Mayors (not Kings, as this is an impermanent place) rule this place, and are typically other dwarves. The people of Forgehome still recall the reign of Keldo, the halfling, as a prosperous peace time for the city.



Forgehome keeps contact with the nearest dwarven kingdom, and much of the trade flowing from Forgehome goes through there.

##### The Town of Post
While Forgehome has always been described as a "temporary" settlement, they have stayed long enough to populate an outpost between itself and the [[Grazing Fields]], the primary source of scavenge for Forgehome. As an outpost of an outpost, Post is very insular and protective of it's people and goods. Although it cannot compare to the fortress known as Forgehome, Post is well defended by constructed spikewalls and active guard towers.

##### Deepreach
The tale of Deepreach is a proud but sad one. The failure of a dwarven kingdom; its riches still lost in the Deep.

## Governance
### The Mayorship
As a city-state associated with a royal kingdom, Forgehome elects a Mayor once every eight years, of which the previous Mayor serves two, while the new Mayor travels to the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] to personally confirm their allegiance to the [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]].

Mayors can serve be re-elected into their position without restriction to the number of terms served, as was the case in the incredible consecutive re-election of [[Keldo the Sweet]] for 64 years.
