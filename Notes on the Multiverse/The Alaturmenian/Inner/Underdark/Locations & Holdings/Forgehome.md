### Background
Forgehome is one of the largest settlements on this side of the surface, and primarily acts as a mining town. Forgehome is an extended outpost of

##### Forgehome
```
The largest dwarven settlement this side of the surface, a mining town, soon to be moved on from. The Mayors (not Kings, as this is an impermanent place) rule this place, and are typically other dwarves. The people of Forgehome still recall the reign of Keldo, the halfling, as a prosperous peace time for the city.

The dwarves of Forgehome have grown rightly suspect of outsiders, and will only allow parties including their dwarven cousins to seek semi-permanent refuge here, although if they are proven trustworthy, the denizens are willing to commit trade. [[Bosi]] runs the "Outlander Exchange" in Forgehome, and is one of the few trusted to engage with outsiders.

Forgehome keeps contact with the nearest dwarven kingdom, and much of the trade flowing from Forgehome goes through there.

The tale of Deepreach is a proud but sad one. The failure of a dwarven kingdom; its riches still lost in the Deep.

##### The Town of Post
While Forgehome has always been described as a "temporary" settlement, they have stayed long enough to populate an outpost between itself and the [[Grazing Fields]], the primary source of scavenge for Forgehome. As an outpost of an outpost, Post is very insular and protective of it's people and goods. Although it cannot compare to the fortress known as Forgehome, Post is well defended by constructed spikewalls and active guard towers.
