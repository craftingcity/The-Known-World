The House of the Drow; as seen in [[Varis Co.]]. Currently residing inside the fungal haven of [[Ootool]], but recently were removed from [[Ungaethram]] due to their Heretic Beliefs!

The Whitimores follow the old ways of Vhaeraun and his ideology. They wish for a harmonious Drow Underdark where-from-which they will rule Alaturmen.

Please see [[Varis Co.]] for the surviving members of the Whitimore court.
