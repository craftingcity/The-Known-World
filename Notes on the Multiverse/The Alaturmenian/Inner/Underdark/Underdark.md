# Features of the Underdark

I've stolen a lot of junk from [this pdf](https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1517/28/1517289863662.pdf).

[This](https://worldbuilderblog.me/2014/05/06/the-underdark/) was also a good resource to draw from
I have imported some of #realmshelp, which I recommend reading before game.
This [pdf](https://d1vzi28wh99zvq.cloudfront.net/pdf_previews/264119-sample.pdf) is a good one for creating encounters from thin air, including what theyre doing and some complications or factors in combat and such. Very much recommend when finishing [[Underdark Travel Table]]


## Structure
The Underdark is known for two sections; the shallows and the deep. The shallows and the deep mix like anything else in the worlds. The features of this place change, and over the weeks and months, the rock breathes and moves.

The rock of this place is featured; Darkrock drinks in the light of the place, both sources natural and otherwise, Glowstone does the opposite, providing the light by which many creatures live, Wormrock is a nutritional boon to the creatures here, as its collection process is easy and it is edible to those who could stomach the taste, and Bloodrock makes some of the tunnels of this place, and the fights in the tunnels are most brutal.

## King's Highway
The tunnels were the screams of a tortured god, Torog, whom is believed to have finally died. Now Lolth is the Queen of the Underdark, and drow, mindflayer and other factions vie for the throne.

The "King's Highway" is the largest and most permanent tunnels through this plane. The blood of Torog gives magic to it. Crusted blood and puss fill the gouges against the walls and the tunnels themselves. Ranging from 50 to 200 feet in diameter, they are the quickest yet most dangerous path through the underdark.

## Threats
Drow make their home in the deep sections of the underdark, and make cities and townships in which to live. 

Groups of dwarves live here in the underdark. Forged from the stone above, and delving deep into the below; they live in the shallows, for they understand the threat of digging too deep.

Their far cousins, the Duergar, work the stone of this plane as the dwarves do above, but have little care for the honor and companionship of traditional dwarven families. Carved from the rock of the Deep, Duergar take slaves to mine for them and to eat.

Unnatural oozes and mushrooms (such as the fearsome Deathcap) make their home in the tunnels and dark forests of this place. These "natural threats" are tended by Troglodytes who grow their food and scavenge what they can from others.

Aberrations like Grik, Beholder, etc. come from the Spawning Fields. The Mind Flayers come from there too, but make their homes in the deeper dungeons and ruins that are scattered around this plane. The pack hunting plate-beasts known as Kruthik are one of the less terrifying natural born threats here in the underdark.

The #goblinoid have always been here, although they quickly lost to the drow's cunning and the duergar's hatred. Some small cities exist, and few would trust a humaniod.

Dragons make their homes here too. 

Purple worms.

## History
Few communities of humans live in the underdark, and those that do are no longer truly human. Madness and adaption has led even the people of "Refuge" to become something other; translucent skin, light hair, wiry frames from eating the moss and mud and rock. "Refuge" is guarded by a group of cursed adventurers that turn to and from stone, only defending when absolutely necessary.

## Entrances
A mineshaft, literally dug too deep
A beholder's new lair as it carved its way up to the surface
A really bad cave
Hobgoblin punish hole

# Shallows
The Kings Highway rarely reaches the shallows. This is where most visitors and non-natives stop their journeys.

### Forgehome
The largest dwarven settlement this side of the surface, a mining town, soon to be moved on from. The Mayors (not Kings, as this is an impermanent place) rule this place, and are typically other dwarves. The people of Forgehome still recall the reign of Keldo, the halfling, as a prosperous peace time for the city.

The dwarves of Forgehome have grown rightly suspect of outsiders, and will only allow parties including their dwarven cousins to seek semi-permanent refuge here, although if they are proven trustworthy, the denizens are willing to commit trade. [[Bosi]] runs the "Outlander Exchange" in Forgehome, and is one of the few trusted to engage with outsiders.

Forgehome keeps contact with the nearest dwarven kingdom, and much of the trade flowing from Forgehome goes through there.

The tale of Deepreach is a proud but sad one. The failure of a dwarven kingdom; its riches still lost in the Deep.

### Maelbrathyr
Known to some as "the Taken Place", this was once a proud city in the Marshes of the [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples|southwest]]. It now rests at the edge of a massive abyss, its tiers giving a great view into a painful death.

The citizenry is composed of many teiflings, and each from a noble house of old. 

### Dark Lake Ziggurat
Kuo-toas surround the dark lake and make their home in it. The Ziggurat is alien in construction, too perfect to be made by hand, too imperfect to be made by divine. The Kuo-toas protect the Ziggurat and worship it.

The Ziggurat connects the planes, and is one of the so called [[Anchors of the Multiverse]]

### Hraak Azul
A flowing and writhing mushroom city inhabited (unnecessarily) by clans of troglodyte. The troglodytes use the fungal altars to create colored Scales that they value highly.

### Howling Warrens
No food grows here. The water is polluted. Feral humanoids make their home here and hunt eachother, but they are not the greatest threat. The sounds of the cavetunnels generate a horrible piercing wail. Below this place, one of Torog's Torture Chambers lies here ([[Glutton's Teeth]], to be accurate). The implements of destruction are a boon for some, but a healthy dose of reality should be doled to those who attempt to enter; this is the place of an angry god.

### Hunting Grounds
Groups of young dragon congregate here, food being plentiful for them, and hunt lesser prey together for the continued survival of themselves. Old dragons are run out, as they could easily disrupt the balance of the Grounds.

## Depths
