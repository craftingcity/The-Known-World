# Thanatos
## Garden of the Glutton
#### A sub-region of the [[Abyss]]
## Boundaries
## Contents

Souls of all the capitalists
	- "SOUL mines", get it

dense housing, terrible working conditions, and a reagen-omics style Faith economy
	- each soul gets fed to a demon, that demon gets fed to a demon, that demon goes to Orcus
	- sometimes we eat the mortals that come here for fun, and then their soul too

in the wild, between "demon-cities" and "soul mines", things like evil rivers, evil towers, evil cults, slave-bands, and wandering scavengers
