Harmony is a layer of [[Elysium]] that holds a collective battery of all Good - a blinding force of Faith that frees all. 

Harmony is itself both the layer and the collective. It is not feasible to imagine mortality existing in or around Harmony.

[[Annaraura]] is the singular focused energy of Harmony as perceptible by mortals; she is Good as the Weave can behold it.
