The Tower of Limbo is a tall tower of flat black opaque material. Inside, it is hollow, and living people make home and hearth in this cylindrical hollow. This is the center point of the multiverse. Here, stable *gates* lead to each and every plane of existence, and are surrounded by large towns of local-ish inhabitants.

Those people that make there way here come for the great connections that can be made, as it requires someone of great means to even know of [[Limbo]]'s existence, let alone attend its one place of living. 

The [[Queen of Swords]] rules this place, and it has a few rules that are enforced capitally, immediately.

> 1. No open disdain
>	     A. Explicit violence clause
>	     B. Explicit bigotry clause
> 2. No worship
