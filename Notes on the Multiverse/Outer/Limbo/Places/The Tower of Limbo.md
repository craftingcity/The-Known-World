# The Tower of Limbo
## The City of Gates

The Tower of Limbo is a tall tower of flat black opaque material. Inside, the city lives on the walls of the hollow cylinder. This is the center point of the multiverse. Here, stable *gates* lead to each and every plane of existence, and are surrounded by large towns of local-ish inhabitants.

Those people that make their way here come for the great connections that can be made, as it requires someone of great means to even know of [[Limbo]]'s existence, let alone attend its one place of living. 

Any "divine" spells or powers are very simply unavailable to their wielders in this place; no connection to a greater power than the Queen can be made within the Tower.

The [[Queen of Swords]] rules this place, and it has a few rules that are enforced capitally, immediately, and irrevocably.

> 1. No open disdain
>	     A. Explicit violence clause
>	     B. Explicit bigotry clause
> 2. No worship
> 		A. Explicit spellcasting clause
> 		B. Explicit divine non-spell-power clause

> Not much was known about the Queen of Swords, because few in the city ever saw her, and those who did never spoke to her, or rather, she never spoke in answer to anyone. There was never any doubt she was real, because she had been seen hovering over the streets of the Tower on many occasions. 
> Any who tried to interact with her at such times found their skin erupting in bloody wounds when she gazed upon them, ... so it was not considered a good sign if she was heard to be about in the streets. Those who had seen her and lived to tell of it described her as being ensconced in sparkling blades. Eventually, she would vanish again into nothingness. 
> Whatever she was, she was not mortal.
