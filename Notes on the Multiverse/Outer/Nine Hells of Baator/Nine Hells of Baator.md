### Layered Structure
#### Avernus, First Layer of Hell
The first circle, Avernus, hosts the [[Astral Sea#River Styx]] in Baator. Being Baator's largest beachhead, it has been ravaged by the [[Blood Wars of Fiends]].

#### Dis, Second Layer of Hell
The second layer is composed of nearly all harshly chopped mountain, but it plays host to a large city of the same name. As far as most visitors are concerned, the city and the layer are one and the same.

#### Minauros, Third Layer of Hell
The third layer is a endless toxic swamp consistenly berated by harsh winds, hail, and acid rain, dotted with minor pockets of civilization built of stone.

#### Phlegethos, Fourth Layer of Hell
A blazing desolation of fire and lava, the fourth layer is host to a place known as The Pit of Flame
