### Layered Structure
#### Avernus, First Layer of Hell
The first circle, is Baator's largest beachhead, it has been ravaged by the [[Blood Wars of Fiends]]. Legions of [[Devil Specifics]] marched to repel the hordes of [[Demon Specifics]]

#### Dis, Second Layer of Hell
The second layer is composed of nearly all harshly chopped mountain, but it plays host to a large city of the same name. As far as most visitors are concerned, the city and the layer are one and the same.

#### Minauros, Third Layer of Hell
The third layer is a endless toxic swamp consistenly berated by harsh winds, hail, and acid rain, dotted with minor pockets of civilization built of stone.

#### Phlegethos, Fourth Layer of Hell
A blazing desolation of fire and lava, the fourth layer is host to a place known as The Pit of Flame, a large pit of *hell-fire*, a flame of such strength it bypasses only the strongest fire resistances - and one of the worst punishments available to those who break the Laws of Baator.

#### Stygia, Fifth Layer of Hell
A vast fozen sea of icebergs and floating sheets. It is named after the [[River Styx]], which flows throughout the layer. Some of the sheets host large cities, and navigation between these settlements was relatively easy because of the presence of the Styx.

#### Malbolge, Sixth Layer of Hell
The landscape of the layer is a steep, craggy, infinite incline that often experiences avalanches. Large fortress of copper are teardrop shapped to repel avalanches. Thoughout the plane, built along the slopes were pillars of adamantine that could support the avalanches, atop which platforms held suspended cages that held condemned devils. Prisoners were constantly injured by the incessant rockfalls, but never killed.

#### Maladomini, Seventh Layer of Hell
Maladomini is the seventh layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. It is an endless field of ruined and decaying cities and the center for all the bureaucracy of the Nine Hells. These cities are constantly being rebuilt and redestroyed on a quest for perfection.
