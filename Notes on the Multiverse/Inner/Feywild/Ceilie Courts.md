# Ceilie Courts
## History
The Ceilie Courts are the fey courts that "organize" the [[Feywild]]. They are ruled by four individual Seasonal Monarchs. These monarchs impose their order on their subjects. Seasonal Fey in the courts are hard-pressed to find reception from Seasonal Fey outside their season. Non-Seasonal fey do not have this issue, and work with many monarchs and members of the courts semi-freely.
