# Cenva Minyo
#### *for the hatred of fire, we are home here*
## Description
The ancient order who's first members survived the [[Great Fires]]. They now task themselves with maintaining a clear path to Walk on Alaturmen and revenge for their Fallen.

See also [[Economics of Cenva Minyo]]

## History
Its oldest members are the survivors of the [[Great Fires]]. These people have written and kept the stories of thousands for more than a hundred years, but like many of its earliest members, stories from before the fire have been mostly lost.

After the burning, those that learned to survive began to regroup in the [[Actstow Hills]] and quickly found themselves forming and joining Cenva Minyo - swearing vengeance for their ancestors and promising power for their descendants. 

Cenva Minyo has a longstanding treaty with the [[Dwarven Kingdom Actstow]].

### Symbolism
A triangle - representing the first tents Cenva Minyo stayed in after the flames. Inside, at its base, stands a simply represented city - [[The Old|Minyostalma]] - above which the "sky" (upper portion of the triangle) is filled with a vertically symmetrical flame - representing their hatred for what [[Its Greatness]] has done.
