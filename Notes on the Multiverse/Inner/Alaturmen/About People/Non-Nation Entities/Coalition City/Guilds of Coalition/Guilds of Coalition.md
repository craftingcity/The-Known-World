# The Guilds of Coalition

The Guilds of Coalition in Alaturmen are considered by most of the "civilized" people of Alaturmen to be the greater governance - something that collects your leader and your ally's leader and your enemy's leader.

The Guilds are collected together at the twice annual Communicae, alongside representatives of the greater national states of Coalition.

## [[Guild of Crafters]]
The Guild of Crafters is responsible for keeping the knowledge of processes and crafts and ensuring their profitability

## [[Guild of Merchants]]
The Guild of Merchants is responsible for managing inventory for the City of Coalition, and monitoring intra-national trades, resolving value disputes, and the like.

## [[Ranger's Guild|Guild of Rangers]]
The Ranger's Guild is responsible for keeping the citizenry of all Alaturmen (not just members of nations agreed to Coalition) safe from the dangers of the Wildland and the places beyond.

## [[Guild of Adventurers]]
The Guild of Adventurers are responsible for managing the dare-devils and neir-duels of Coalition's upper class.
