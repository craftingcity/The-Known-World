# Guild of Wizards
## History
The Guild of Wizards is responsible for the responsible use of Weave Arcane by the citizens of Alaturmen, as well as recording the history of our world and (in)validating legends or other creative works. 

For a list of High Power Wizards (including those not on the Council of Mages) see [[Loose Wizard NPCs]].

## Governance

### Council of Mages
The Council of Mages are the few people responsible for the use of Weave Arcane on Alaturmen. Each is titled the Mage of their domain.

The Red Mage, [[Alergra Barrowinch]]; Evocation / Enchantment
The Blue Mage, [[The Wizard In Blue]]; Divination
The Yellow Mage, [[Nicolas Talaveem]]; Illusion / Conjuration
The White Mage, [[Pirre Tald]]; Abjuration
The Black Mage, [[Qiell Tilemundon]]; Necromancy

### Luh'turiñgolë Courier Service
The elvish word in the title of the Guild's courier service translates roughly to "a magical horse with magics and wisdom". It is the task of the Luh'turingole to transport information and objects throughout Alaturmen as authorized by the [[Guilds of Coalition]] at their discretion and necessity.
