## History
The Guild of Adventurers are responsible for managing the dare-devils and neir-duels of Coalition's upper class. The Guild of Adventurers works with all of the other guilds in procurement, export, defense, or anything else that could possibly be thought of. They are responsible as well for keeping the greater [[Laws of Adventuring]] and marking those who break them.

The Guild of Adventurers is responsible for equipping and supplying a number of Adventuring Parties. Requisition by request is the most common way parties become equipped by the Guild, but Outstanding Contracts completed by independent actors or parties are sometimes rewarded by this standardized equipment.

Given that the Guild is responsible for their adventurers, and by extension, their equipment, the Guild marks both the individual equipment and the packages they are contained within - typically a simple wooden crate - with a letter code.
