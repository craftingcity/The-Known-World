### Quote
> "Where war comes to die, and peace comes to trade."
### General Public Disposition
The common folk of Coalition City are personally focused, and do not make superfluous efforts to assist strangers. We are the capitol of the world, and visitors are too common.

### Background


## Important Places
### Wards
In the center of the city, the [[Wheel Ward]] holds the overflow from the other wards, and serves as a central market and public common space. 
In the North, the largest and most prominent gate stands tall as the [[Iron Ward]]. 
The [[Ivory Ward]] holds the craftsfolk and their opulent structures and gaudy architecture. 
The [[Moss Ward]] pales in comparison, housing the many commonfolk in dense apartments and housing complexes. 
The [[Stone Ward]] was the first residential ward to be built, although few folks have lived through its long, dragging construction. 
The [[Jade Ward]] houses new money merchants, and is a common mark for the thieves of the City. 
Much of the industry that supplies the city is contained within the [[Steel Ward]]. 
The administration of the city, including offices of the many [[The Guilds|Guilds]] of the city is held in the [[Ruby Ward]]. 
The [[Golden Ward]] stands as the hall of the merchants, where no item can't be found, so they say.

The city itself is governed by an elected body of [[Parlement]], formed from representatives of each Ward. In an effort to keep peace in the Known World, the City hosts [[Communicaes]] in the Winter and the Summer where each of the surrounding entities (each of the four "nations") and the City itself come together to create a communicative and cooperative council. During the communicaes, representatives of smaller groups (such as a party, company, or otherwise) come to the council to air their concerns or comments.
