## Coalition City
A large city in the mountains that split the east and west stands in a circular valley breaking the mountain range. Split into 9 wards, each functioning its purpose in the city. In the center of the city, the [[Wheel Ward]] holds the overflow from the other wards, and serves as a central market and public common space. In the North, the largest and most prominent gate stands tall as the [[Iron Ward]]. The [[Ivory Ward]] holds the craftsfolk and their opulent structures and gaudy architecture. The [[Moss Ward]] pales in comparison, housing the many commonfolk in dense apartments and housing complexes. The [[Stone Ward]] was the first residential ward to be built, although few folks have lived through its construction. The [[Jade Ward]] houses the new money "richies", and is a common mark for the thieves of the City. The standing army and its industy is contained in the [[Steel Ward]]. Much of the administration of the city, including offices of the many [[The Guilds|Guilds]] of the city is held in the [[Ruby Ward]]. The [[Golden Ward]] stands as the hall of the merchants, and includes an airstrip for mass transit of many goods.

### Government
The city itself is governed by an elected body of [[Parlement]], formed from representatives of each Ward. In an effort to keep peace in the Known World, the City hosts [[Comminicaes]] in the Winter and the Summer where each of the surrounding entities (each of the four "nations") and the City itself come together to create a communicative and cooperative council. During the communicaes, representatives of smaller groups (such as a party, company, or otherwise) come to the council to air their concerns or comments.
