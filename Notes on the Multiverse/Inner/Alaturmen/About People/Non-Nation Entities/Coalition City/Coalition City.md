# Coalition City
## Holding of [[Guilds of Coalition]]
### Located in [[Deakred Range]], ~088:097
## Description
Coalition City is a huge metropolis in the [[Deakred Range]] that is split into 9 wards, each performing a specific purpose for the city. 
### "Where war comes to die, and peace comes to trade."
### General Public Disposition

The common folk of Coalition City are personally focused, and do not make superfluous efforts to assist strangers. Most folks who live in the city are too busy to make time for anyone who cannot produce them value.

The richer "nobles" and governmental figures are also quite busy, but many travelers come to the city to visit these powerful peoples, making their disposition more unique to themselves.

### Background
This city is the largest city in [[Central Alaturmen]], attracting the majority of trade in the known world. It is placed in the direct center of the known world, in the eastern half of the [[Deakred Range]], in fact carved into 

Individuals, like wanders or merchants, as well as the major [[Merchant Companies and their Routes|Merchant Companies]] come from around the world with the intention to stay for weeks or months at a time - this city is built in segments, each with their own feel and use.

The walls of the city are all, unless otherwise described, are a grey recomposite stone brick that forms 40-foot walls - not that they are much protection from anyone more than 1000 yards away, upon the natural cliffside.

#### The Wheel Ward
In the center of the city, the [[Wheel Ward]] holds the overflow from the other wards, and serves as a central market and public common space. Its walls form a circular space, again formed into a torus by the central *building*.

#### The Iron Ward
The [[Iron Ward]] is one of the major entrances into the City, and it's architecture stands tall and foreboding - this is a reasonable welcome in the north, where both the cultures are *militant*, for lack of a better word. The buildings in this 

#### The Ivory Ward
The [[Ivory Ward]] holds the craftsfolk and their opulent structures and gaudy architecture. 

#### The Moss Ward
The [[Moss Ward]] pales in comparison, housing the many commonfolk in dense apartments and housing complexes. 

#### The Stone Ward
The [[Stone Ward]] was the first residential ward to be built, although few folks have lived through its long, dragging construction. 

#### The Jade Ward
The [[Jade Ward]] houses new money merchants, and is a common mark for the thieves of the City. 

#### The Steel Wards
Much of the industry that supplies the city is contained within the [[Steel Ward]]. 

#### The Ruby Ward
The administration of the city, including offices of the many [[The Guilds|Guilds]] of the city is held in the [[Ruby Ward]]. 

#### The Golden Ward
The [[Golden Ward]] stands as the hall of the merchants, where no item can't be found, so they say.

## Governance
The city itself is governed by an elected body of [[Parlement]], formed from representatives of each Ward. In an effort to keep peace in the Known World, the City hosts [[Communicaes]] in the Winter and the Summer where each of the surrounding entities (each of the four "nations") and the City itself come together to create a communicative and cooperative council. During the communicaes, representatives of smaller groups (such as a party, company, or otherwise) come to the council to air their concerns or comments.
