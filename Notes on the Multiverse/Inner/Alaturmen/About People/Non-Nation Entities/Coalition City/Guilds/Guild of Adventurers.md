The Guild of Adventurers are responsible for managing the dare-devils and neir-duels of Coalition's upper class. The Guild of Adventurers works with all of the other guilds in procurement, export, defense, or anything else that could possibly be thought of. They are responsible as well for keeping the greater [[Laws of Adventuring]] and marking those who break them.
