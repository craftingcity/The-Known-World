# Wheernat Clan
## History
The Wheernat Clan has been a powerful family of trickster goblins before Alaturmen came to have a name. In the first fifteen years of time, the Wheernat Clan was weary to encounter the newer entities that now roamed Alaturmen, and for seemingly good reason; the first of these people to come to power became known as the [[Bandit Lords]].

The Wheernat Clan would come to develop a very xenophobic culture as a result of their encounters with these so-called Lords. As the Wheernat Clan fled east into the [[Illburn Forest]] from the rule of the [[Bandit Lords]], they would come to rest in the deepest parts of the forest, as far from any encampments as they could muster.

In 032AF, Mengugu [[Grokank Wheernat]] signed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]], declaring the Wheernat Clan as a national entity that is directly allied with the other Blood Clans against the [[Bandit Lords]].

Over the next thirty years, the Wheernat Clan was instrumental in the downfall of the [[Bandit Lords]]
