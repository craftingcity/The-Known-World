# Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact
The Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact is a #text that was written by the ancient Hobgoblins that describes the Lawful contract on which the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clans]] functions. [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] is a lawful [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clans]], headed by [[Simonson Clan]], and as such, the rules and regulations described herein are followed. 

> My knowledge is in my blade and my elder; where is yours when that precious library is burning? Does your journal truly contain the history of this world? No. Perhaps your blood knows something worthwhile

### Structure
"... Clans are headed by the Mangugu. They answer to the twelve Gurr'ix-Yuggwulp of the clan. Mangugu bear three Alman at all times. Make warriors at your discretion. Protect your own and theirs at all costs..."

### Imperialism

"... and it is of our nature to claim what may be ours by force and by maneuver, for no cost is too great for your Gurr'ix-Yuggwulp's child..."

This is the "Imperialism" clause. It has been cited in many official war declarations between the [[Northeastern Clan Leaders]]. Most leaders understand it to mean that because of our continually growing population, we have a right to more land as we grow. It is necessary to fight for this land, and to defend our own for the sake of the family so we should expect our enemies and allies to do the same.

### Honorable Combat

"...in your heart of hearts you know that your enemies could just as soon be your brothers ... afford them the mercy you would show your brother; attack not when warriors are pregnant, sick, young, or elderly."

This is often taken literally; don't attack when these conditions are offered. Most Clans will do a pre-war ritual in line of sight of their enemies with this clause mind, and those that share this culture further this by sending their eldest, youngest, or otherwise weakest warrior to inspect their opponents. 

Many times have parties been interrupted by a pregnant warrior entering, declaring Pact War, and leaving unharmed with many delicacies in hand. This is typically used as a tactic to avoid the negative notoriety that comes with instigating *for conquer* wars, and would rather their enemies seem the aggressor to other Clans.

This is a cultural violation of the intention of Honorable Combat, and even though that is not exactly the word, the Clans despise false tactics during Pact War.
