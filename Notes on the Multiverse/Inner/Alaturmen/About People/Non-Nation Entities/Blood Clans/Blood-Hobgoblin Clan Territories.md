# Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Territories
![[KingdomOfProsper-105AF.png]]
*North-east Alaturmen circa 100AF.*
## History
In the time before time, the goblinoid were united as one. Thirty-two years after [[Tetrimoc]] fell, and after thirty-two years of subjugation by the [[Bandit Lords]], the Hobgoblin of the Eastern half of the [[Great Northern Forests]] wrote and signed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] before making war against all others. After the fall of the [[Bandit Lords]] and many years, these Clans made peace with their newest neighbor; [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

Not long after their peace, they turned on each other, though they were never truly allied, and they still fight in the north-east forests of [[Central Alaturmen]].

## Governance
Each of the Clans is ruled by one Hobgoblin, the Mangugu, who answers to up to twelve Gurr'ix-Yuggwulp, advisor-concubines, and must be near three Alman, basically bodyguards, at all times.

Seven family names reside on the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]];

#### [[Simonson Clan]]
A elder-matriarchy of fierce militants. The [[Arthur Simonson|son]] of the [[Amelia Simonson|last matron]] rules [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].
#### [[Garqwak Clan]]
One half of the [[Wakquk Twins]], [[Lily-Mae Garqwak]], now heads the western half of the Wakquk clan as their new matriarch. 
#### [[Hurraquk Clan]]
One half of the [[Wakquk Twins]], [[Marley Hurraquk]], now heads the eastern half of the Wakquk clan as their new matriarch.
#### [[Emorin Clan]]
A bureaucracy based community of permanent communities that feed large merchant bands. 
#### [[Scrivin Clan]]
A elder-patriarchy of fierce militants. Many bands of the [[Scrivin Clan]] make Soul-contracts for magical powers with powerful entities.
#### [[Bulgpim Clan]]
A caste clan of permanent farming communities. 
#### [[Wheernat Clan]]
A socialist clan of pseudo-nomadic hunter-gatherers. 

## Culture
#### Heritage
The Blood-Hobgoblin Clans are comprised mostly of, you guessed it, Hobgoblin. There were many Hobgoblin families who were dissatisfied with the coming of the new peoples of Alaturmen and formed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] as an escape from the [[Bandit Lords]].

#### Language
Most people in these territories speak both [[Goblin (language)]] and [[King's Common (language)]].

#### Belief
The people who live in this place bind themselves and their clan mates to the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]].
