# Northeastern Blood-Hobgoblin Territories
## History
In the time before time, the goblinoid were united as one. Thirty-two years after [[Tetrimoc]] fell, and after thirty-two years of subjugation by the [[Bandit Lords]], the Hobgoblin of the Eastern half of the [[Great Northern Forests]] wrote and signed the [[Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] before making war against all others. After the fall of the [[Bandit Lords]] and many years, these Clans made peace with their newest neighbor; [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

Not long after their peace, they turned on each other, though they were never truly allied, and they still fight in the north-east forests of [[Central Alaturmen]].

## Governance
Each of the Clans is ruled by one Hobgoblin, the Mangugu, who answers to up to twelve Gurr'ix-Yuggwulp, advisor-concubines, and must be near three Alman, basically bodyguards, at all times.

Seven family names reside on the [[Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact]];

#### [[Simonson Clan]]
#### [[Garqwak Clan]]
#### [[Hurraquk Clan]]
#### [[Emorin Clan]]
#### [[Scrivin Clan]]
#### [[Bulgpim Clan]]
#### [[Wheernat Clan]]
