# Blood-Hobgoblin Clans
![[KingdomOfProsper-105AF.png]]
*[[Northeastern Central]] Alaturmen as of 105AF*
## History
In the time before time, the goblinoid were united as one. Thirty-two years after [[Tetrimoc]] fell, and after thirty-two years of subjugation by the [[Bandit Lords]], the Hobgoblin of the Eastern half of the [[Great Northern Forests]] wrote and signed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] declaring war upon any other. After the fall of the [[Bandit Lords]] and after many years, these Clans made peace with their newest neighbor; [[The Kingdom of Prosper]].

Not long after this peace, they turned onto each other and they still fight in the [[Illburn Forest]] to the northeast of [[Arthur's Prairie]].

## Governance
The Clans are all independent, and govern themselves as they wish for the most part, but they all follow the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]], including structure and the like.

Each of the Clans is ruled by one Hobgoblin, the Mangugu, who answers to up to twelve Gurr'ix-Yuggwulp (advisor-concubines), and must be near three Alman (~bodyguards), at all times.

Six family names reside on the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]];

#### [[Simonson Clan]]
A elder-matriarchy of fierce militants. The [[Arthur Simonson|son]] of the [[Amelia Simonson|last matron]] rules [[The Kingdom of Prosper]], and this clan has become all but defunct in the politics of the "true" Blood-Clans.

#### Wakquk Clan
The [[Wakquk Twins]] have split their mother's claim into two; the [[Hurraquk Clan]] and the [[Garqwak Clan]]. Many consider this to be a petty disagreement between siblings gone too far - though those without their rule are happy to see disruption in their structures of power. 

#### [[Emorin Clan]]
A bureaucracy based community of permanent communities that feed large merchant bands. Many consider the Emorin to be the wisest of the Blood-Hobgoblin, as well as the most sharp-tongued.

#### [[Scrivin Clan]]
A elder-patriarchy of fierce militants. Many bands of the [[Scrivin Clan]] make Soul-contracts for magical powers with powerful entities. Other Blood-Clans unite against the Clan Scrivin often, as it is in everyone's best interest that they stay in a position of low power.

#### [[Bulgpim Clan]]
A caste clan of permanent farming communities. Few people find communication with members of the Bulgpim clan fruitful, as they speak a powerfully distant dialect of Goblin to eachother. Few high-caste members of this clan speak a common language (usually [[King's Common (language)]]) for the purposes of facilitating trade and festivity.

#### [[Wheernat Clan]]
A socialist clan of pseudo-nomadic hunter-gatherers. The people of the Wheernat clan are taught to move with swiftness and grace, as well as to maintain a focus on your immediate community before the community of the others. It is a rarity to meet with a member of the clan who does not wish to be speaking with you, specifically. 

## Culture
#### Heritage
The Blood-Hobgoblin Clans are composed mostly of, you guessed it, Hobgoblin. There were many Hobgoblin families who were dissatisfied with the coming of the new peoples of Alaturmen and formed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] as an escape from the [[Bandit Lords]].

#### Language
Most people in these territories speak both [[Goblin (language)]] and [[King's Common (language)]].

#### Belief
The people who live in this place bind themselves and their clan mates to the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]]. Each of the clans have a unique perspective and interpretation of this document, which presents itself as a fairly unique spread of cultures.
