The Wakquk Twins, [[Marley Hurraquk]] and [[Lily-Mae Garqwak]], were born to [[Gail Wakquk]], who ruled a great portion of the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Territories]] in [[Northeastern Central]] [[Alaturmen]]. After Gail's death, her allies supported one of her two children over the other; neither had a clear claim to the matriarchy as they were born on the same day. As civil war broke, the [[Hurraquk Clan]] and the [[Garqwak Clan]] were formed. The twins have refused to speak since they have made tenuous, although heavily supported, peace.
