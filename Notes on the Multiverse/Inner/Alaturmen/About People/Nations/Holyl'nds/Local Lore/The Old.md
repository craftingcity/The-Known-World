# Minyostalma
#### The Ruins of the Old Empire
## Holding of [[The Church of the White Flame]]
### Located in [[Central Holyl'nd]], X:Y
## Description
### "The Old is more hell than ruin. This place is why the Fire burns."

![[TheOld-080AF-player.png]]

Minyostalma is a collective name for the villages and townships that surround the most major city in the "Old Elven Empire" that never was. It has been cordoned off from the rest of [[The Holyl'nds]] with a large military presence - though most of the soldiers holding the line here are preventing people from leaving more than stopping people from coming in.

The Ruins to the west and north of the central city are the most picked over, as scavengers have frequented the area for dozens of years at this point. As you come closer and closer to the central Temple structure in the walled city-proper, the more dangerous the scavenging becomes, and even the most prepared scavengers do not spend long inside The Old.

### Things Aren't Right Here...
#### Casting
##### Divine & Natural Spellcasters
While many of the most common spellcasters draw on divine or natural powers, those casters will find that their powers have been stripped from them in this place. While you may call upon a natural or divine power in this place, you are sure to fail to reach them. Repeated attempts may draw upon the ire of the Old...

	> When a "divine" or "natural" caster attempts to cast a spell, they may expend a number of hit-die equal to the spell's level. If they do not, they take that number of d10 psycic damage instead. This effect only occurs after a caster's first spell or after 4 hours in The Old.
	> After this point, spell slots may not be expended and spell may not be cast - including cantrips.
	> The following dnd5e spellcaster classes are efffected; Druids, Rangers, Clerics, Paladins, Warlocks.

##### Arcane Spellcasters
Where their Divine companions are personally punished for their casting, and may be unable to safely cast spells at all, Arcane spellcasters are often overwhelmed with the effectiveness of their spells while they are cast within the Old.

	> When a "arcane" caster attempts to cast a spell, they make a Arcana check equal to five plus the value of the spell slot spent times five. 
	> 	If they succeed, they take a number of d6 psycic damage equal to the spell's level, and the spell is cast as per usual. Then, they roll on the Wild Magic table. 
	> 	If they fail, they take a number of d12 psycic damage equal to the spell's level, and then spell's effective level is doubled (as if it was cast with a spell slot twice the value of the spent slot).
	> The following dnd5e spellcaster classes are efffected; Artificer, Bard, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster, Sorcerer, Wizard

#### Hazards
##### Anomalies
Areas within the Old are subject to dense knots in the Weave that manifest as an area of powerful magical disruption. The Scavengers of the area have taken to calling these places Anomalies or Anomalous Fields, depending on their understanding of what is actually creating the aforementioned knot.

To notice an Anomaly or an Anomalous Field, a creature may simply view it on a DC 16 Perception check of the area. Otherwise, a creature may attempt to activate anomalies they cannot see. This is typically done by throwing a piece of rubbish along a path, walking that path, and continuing until opposed by the anomaly, at which point one would maneuver around it, when able.

Anomalies do not have charges, in an arcane sense, and can be reactivated immediately. Anomalies are activated by a material (organic or otherwise) disturbing them. Staying within an active anomaly *will* result in severe damage, if not death.

###### Burner
> A burner anomaly is like vents of fire you cannot see until you have stepped over them. The fire will come as quick as it will go, and before you can call their name, your comrade will be ash.

The field of burners is a 10' radius circle. Within this radius, each 5' square has a 1/6 chance of being an activatable space within the field. When one of these spaces is activated, it creates a column of fire 5' tall. This column deals 4d8 fire damage to a creature that occupies it, and 1d8 fire damage to a creature within 5' of it.

###### Comet / Electro
> A comet anomaly is like a ball of fire, moving with the speed of a rolling boulder. While you may think you can dodge it, do your math again. Can you dodge it from behind, and then once more? Artyom could not.

A comet anomaly is a 10' sphere of flame that can occupy any point on a path within a 35' radius sphere. The comet has an Initiative of 15, and will move along this path at a speed of 25' per round. During this time, any creature on the comet's path must make a DC 17 Dexterity Saving Throw. Those creatures take 4d6 fire / lightning damage on a failure, and half that amount on a success.

If a creature enters a space within 5' of the comet anomaly or ends their turn there, they take 4d6 fire / lightning damage.

###### Vortex
> A vortex anomaly is like a powerful wind that will pick you up off your feet and spin you until you begin to separate at the joints. If you somehow keep your limbs, you had better land on your feet. 

The field of vortexes is a 15' radius circle. Within this radius, each 5' square has a 1/8 chance of being an activatable space within the field. When one of these spaces is activated, it creates a gripping wind in a 15' tall cone that has a base diameter of 15', centered on the activated space. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a DC 17 Strength Saving Throw or take 3d12 bludgeoning damage and be flung 10' from the tip of the cone in a random direction.

###### Springboard  
> A springboard anomaly is like a blade of air - if you are lucky, and hit by the flat end, you may fly into the air, if you are not, and hit the sharp end, you will be two parts of a whole corpse.

The springboard anomaly is a 10' diameter circle. When the springboard is activated, creatures within the circle must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity Saving Throw, or be pushed 5' in a random direction. If they fail by 5 or more, they additionally take 4d10 slashing damage.

###### Fruit Punch  
> A fruit punch anomaly is like an overflowing bowl of boiling water - a burn is common, and a death is a horrible sight.

The field of fruit punches is a 15' radius circle. Within this radius, each 5' square has a 1/6 chance of being active for up to 3d6 rounds. While active, creatures who enter the active space or begin their turn there take 3d6 acid damage. 

###### Burnt Fuzz  
> A fuzzball, or a burnt fuzz, whatever you want to call it, is only really a rookie killer. Just don't run. Walk real slow, and you should be fine. Ivan is the worst case I've seen, and he only has burns up to his torso and a wicked trigger twitch.

The burnt fuzz anomaly is a 15' radius circle of copper-green spindly vines. When a creature moves more than 5' in a round through the circle, they take 1d6 lightning damage for each 5' space moved.

###### Gas Cloud  
> A gas cloud anomaly is aptly named - green clouds of toxic gas boil the skin off your muscles and then the muscles off your bones, not that you won't die of inhalation and internal bleeding first.

The field of gas cloud anomalies is a 25' radius circle. Within this radius, each 10' space has a 1/4 chance of being active for 3d6 hours. While active, a creature that begins their turn within the sphere takes 1d8 poison damage. For every turn they have spent in a gas cloud in this anomaly field, the damage increases by 1d8.

### General Public Disposition
Many people who come and go from this place are peaceful folk who need money, and try their luck in the prosperous ruins of the old empire. The most unprepared are those that believe anyone they encounter is as kind as them.

#### Factions
##### Scavengers / Seekers / Scavs
A collective name for the individuals and groups without a greater affiliation to a faction without or within the Old. Most of these people came to find their fortune, and were miserably mistaken. They have likely tried and failed to escape this place, and have instead reluctantly gathered with others to survive in this place.

###### Equipment

##### White-Flame Militants
[[The Church of the White Flame]] is - according to official Guild records - only maintaining a border presence to prevent any further entrance into these very dangerous and historic ruins. Anyone who has actually seen this place can tell you that is not true. Bands of well-equipped soldiers actively patrol the Old and commonly attack on sight.

##### Mercenaries
Hired soldiers willing to keep their employer's identity secret, the Mercenary groups within the Old are mysterious and fickle. While often reliable, when an opportunity presents itself, the Mercenaries betray their well-earned trust for the benefit of their unknown patrons.

##### Extramis
Extramis is a loose collective of ex-soldiers and experienced seekers that claim to be members of [[Arthur's Knights]] with the common drive to liberate Minyostalma into the hands of the Arthurian people. While the validity of their claim to [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] is subject to question, their effectiveness within the Old is not.

##### Fallen
Deep within the Walled ruins, there is some artifact that the White Flame was attempting to destroy when it came to this place so long ago. Those who travel too deep are said to rarely return, and when they do, they are not the same, raving about the *glorious flame* and it's *beautiful oblivion*. The only mercy for them is death. They are beyond reason. Resist them.

## Important Places & Symbolism
Each of the following locations describe the contents of the singular hex-mile they are contained within (excepting the City and Village, which are two and three hex-miles respectively, and are still described below). 

### The Cordon
This region of the Old is known as the Cordon. [[#White-Flame Militants]] hold the majority of this area, and uses this outpost to supply and command operations within the Old performed by these soldiers. 

#### The Western Entrance
The Western Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Western Entrance include both allowing entrants for a fee and disallowing, by fire and force, any unidentified persons from exiting.

Entering this gate leads directly to the area within the Cordon known as the Reserve.

#### The Recreations Camp
The Recreation Camp is directly north of the Reserve. The WFM in the area use the Recreations Camp to relieve the stress of operating within the Old.

Alongside physical recreation games, such as ringtoss or kickball, there are small cabins for warmth, table games, drug use, and sexual recreation.

#### The Killing Fields
The Killing Fields are directly north of the Depot. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old.

A trail exiting this perimeter leads north into the area known as Broken Swamps.

#### The Mudhouse
northeast of the Depot

#### The Reserve
A series of large tents and semi-permanent structures form a small military town. WFM use the Reserve and the surrounding areas as their primary base of operations within the Old.

## Economics
### Death as Business
The primary business within the Old is death. Death as business is fueled by ammunition, fuel, armor, and rations. To most Seekers, modern coinage is generally valued as something easy to throw into anomalous fields as path markers. *Ancient Elven Empire* coins, however, are well positioned within the Old as a token of value given their near-rarity and value. 

Given this, Traders within the Old will often quote prices in Ancient Coin rather than Silver or Gold, but nevertheless they are very willing to take barter exchanges of equal or greater value.
