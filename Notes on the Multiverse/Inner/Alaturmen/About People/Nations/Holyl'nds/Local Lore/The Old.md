# Minyostalma
#### The Ruins of the Old Empire
## Holding of [[The Church of the White Flame]]
### Located in [[Central Holyl'nd]], X:Y
## Description
### "The Old is more hell than ruin. This place is why the Fire burns."

Minyostalma is a collective name for the villages and townships that surround the most major city in the "Old Elven Empire" that never was. It has been cordoned off from the rest of [[The Holyl'nds]] with a large military presence - though most of the soldiers holding the line here are preventing people from leaving more than stopping people from coming in.

The Ruins to the west and north of the central city are the most picked over, as scavengers have frequented the area for dozens of years at this point. As you come closer and closer to the central Temple structure in the walled city-proper, the more dangerous the scavenging becomes, and even the most prepared scavengers do not spend long inside The Old.

#### Things Aren't Right Here...
##### Divinity
While many of the most common casters draw on divine or natural powers, those casters will find that their powers have been stripped from them in this place. While you may call upon a natural or divine power in this place, you are sure to fail to reach them. Repeated attempts may draw upon the ire of the Old...

	> When a "divine" or "natural" caster attempts to cast a spell, they may expend a number of hit-die equal to the spell's level. If they do not, they take that number of d10 necrotic damage instead. This effect only occurs after a caster's first spell or after 4 hours in The Old.


### General Public Disposition
Many people who come and go from this place are peaceful folk who need money, and try their luck in the prosperous ruins of the old empire.

The most unprepared are those that believe anyone they encounter is as kind as them.

##### Scavs
There are small clans of Scavengers who live and fight within the ruins of the city, and some become so proficient in this manner of work, they become professional Scavs. These groups are often hostile with each other and anyone they can not identify, but in times of dire need, they could be convinced to set aside their histories and work together.

##### Fallen
Deep within the Walled ruins, there is some artifact that the White Flame was attempting to destroy when it came to this place so long ago. Those who travel too deep are said to rarely return, and when they do, they are not the same, raving about the glorious flame and it's beautiful oblivion. Soon they will become Fallen, and lose all but the very surface of themselves.
