# Minyostalma
#### The Ruins of the Old Empire
## Holding of [[The Church of the White Flame]]
### Located in [[Central Holyl'nd]], X:Y
## Description
### "The Old is more hell than ruin. This place is why the Fire burns."

![[TheOld-080AF-player.png]]

Minyostalma is a collective name for the villages and townships that surround the most major city in the "Old Elven Empire" that never was. It has been cordoned off from the rest of [[The Holyl'nds]] with a large military presence - though most of the soldiers holding the line here are preventing people from leaving more than stopping people from coming in.

The Ruins to the west and north of the central city are the most picked over, as scavengers have frequented the area for dozens of years at this point. As you come closer and closer to the central Temple structure in the walled city-proper, the more dangerous the scavenging becomes, and even the most prepared scavengers do not spend long inside The Old.

#### Things Aren't Right Here...
##### Casting
###### Divine & Natural Spellcasters
While many of the most common spellcasters draw on divine or natural powers, those casters will find that their powers have been stripped from them in this place. While you may call upon a natural or divine power in this place, you are sure to fail to reach them. Repeated attempts may draw upon the ire of the Old...

	> When a "divine" or "natural" caster attempts to cast a spell, they may expend a number of hit-die equal to the spell's level. If they do not, they take that number of d10 psycic damage instead. This effect only occurs after a caster's first spell or after 4 hours in The Old.
	> The following dnd5e spellcaster classes are efffected; Druids, Rangers, Clerics, Paladins, Warlocks.

###### Arcane Spellcasters
Where their Divine companions are personally punished for their casting, and may be unable to safely cast spells at all, Arcane spellcasters are often overwhelmed with the effectiveness of their spells while they are cast within the Old.

	> When a "arcane" caster attempts to cast a spell, they make a Arcana check equal to five plus the value of the spell slot spent times five. If they succeed, they take a number of d6 psycic damage equal to the spell's level, and the spell is cast as per usual. Then,   If they fail, they take a number of d12 psycic damage equal to the spell's level, and then spell's effective level is doubled (as if it was cast with a spell slot twice the value of the spent slot).

##### Equipment

##### Hazards
###### 

### General Public Disposition
Many people who come and go from this place are peaceful folk who need money, and try their luck in the prosperous ruins of the old empire.

The most unprepared are those that believe anyone they encounter is as kind as them.

##### Seekers
A collective name for the individuals and groups without a greater affiliation to a faction without or within the Old. Most of these people came to find their fortune, and were miserably mistaken. They have likely tried and failed to escape this place, and have instead reluctantly gathered with others to survive in this place.

##### Church Military
[[The Church of the White Flame]] is - according to official Guild records - only maintaining a border presence to prevent any further entrance into these very dangerous and historic ruins. Anyone who has actually seen this place can tell you that is not true. Bands of well-equipped soldiers actively patrol the Old and commonly attack on sight.

##### Mercenaries
Hired soldiers willing to keep their employer's identity secret, the Mercenary groups within the Old are mysterious and fickle. While often reliable, when an opportunity presents itself, the Mercenaries betray their well-earned trust for the benefit of their unknown patrons. 

##### Extramis
Extramis is a loose collective of ex-soldiers and proven seekers that claim to be members of [[Arthur's Knights]] with the common drive to liberate Minyostalma into the hands of the Arthurian people. While the validity of their claim to [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] is subject to question, their effectiveness within the Old is not.

##### Fallen
Deep within the Walled ruins, there is some artifact that the White Flame was attempting to destroy when it came to this place so long ago. Those who travel too deep are said to rarely return, and when they do, they are not the same, raving about the *glorious flame* and it's *beautiful oblivion*. The only mercy for them is death. They are beyond reason. Resist them.
