The Great Fires describe a twenty year period of time where [[Its Greatness]] near indiscriminately burnt away all evidence of life. After reaching what is now the clear border between [[The Church of the White Flame]] and [[The Kingdom of Prosper]], [[Its Greatness]] retreated to [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln|Kanielkiln]] and contained itself there. Soon the people would flock back to the [[The Holyl'nds]] and worship [[Its Greatness]] as their fickle master.

Only human and elven children under five were spared; of them, the surviving formed the faction [[Cenva Minyo]] and have sworn vengeance for their fallen parents.
