# The Church of the White Flame
![[Holy-100AF.png]]
*the area of [[The Holyl'nds]]*

## History
The [[#The Church of the White Flame]] is the main body of government in the [[The Holyl'nds]], as a caste theocracy. They worship [[Its Greatness]] as a great force to be revered for its allowance of containment. 

## Governance
### Castes
The Church of the White flame practices Power-Imbalance-Gaslighting as mechanics of its culture and as in defiance to its genuine god [[Its Greatness]], who wills this to be the way the church is run, as his Spoken have indicated though their words and powers.

It also practices Slavery as a mechanic of its Economy.

Ranking from highest to lowest in station:
- Spoken (the few who draw holy power from White Flame, no matter their race, but we're still gonna look at them with *that* look)
- Firstchurch (high-priest, only based in the [[Holy City of Kanielkiln]], excelling members of Tendered *can* be brought into the ranks of the Firstchurch by a council of Spoken, although **typically** only people of human or elven heritage *may* become Firstchurch)
	- *Guardians* are members of the Firstchurch tasked in caring for a group of Young Tendered. They are not the only member responsible for their education, they are the only member responsible for their safety, though this often is not an issue.
	- While members of Firstchurch supposedly, and technically truthfully, are not allowed outside of [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]], certain members of their rank claim different titles and positions outside of the city. Upon their acceptance of this title, they agree to return no less often than every five years (no matter their race, elves gotta do this five year shit till they quit) or they become enemies of [[Its Greatness]] and Its [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]].
		- *Emparters* are members of the Firstchuch that carry with them a lit flame that is only once removed from [[Its Greatness]]. They are tasked with training and spreading Tendered farther from [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]]. 
		- *Collectors* are members of the Firstchurch that have the ability to decern absolute truth, and patrol their route through the Holyl'nds collecting the Church's cut of revenue and returning it to [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln|Kanielkiln]] and restarting their route.
- Tendered (a priest of a church or other establishment grown and raised for their position)
	- a Tendered is generally the master of a plantation of some kind and the leader of the local church. a town or city can have any number of tendered, but the church's money is not the Tendered's, all other than a certain percentage require some other income to feed themselves and any family take care of. 
	- Certain jobs a Tendered undertakes earns them a special name. While this does come with a minor ascension in status, it is similar to a novice becoming a journeyman.
		- *Detainers* are Tendered who hunt for (undesirable) and bring them to a *Keeper*.
		- *Keepers* are Tendered who train captured (undesirable) into becoming *Unseen*.
- Patron (a patron of an establishment Tended by a member of The Church)
	- there is no difference between Patrons, although those who would train their children to become Tendered
- Unseen (trained undesirable)
	- this is the point at which systemic cultural racism takes its cut, and moves the profits upward from here
	- many Unseen are "free", but cannot find any work other than those that would be performed by "owned" Unseen as well.
- (undesirable) (unclaimed / undefended Goblinoid, Orc, Halfling, Winter-Elves)
	- while their name suggests that one might get rid of them, the (undesirable) are a group that, when captured and enslaved, make wonderful Unseen. 
		- This is the job of select few *Tended*, known as *Keepers*.



## Culture
### Symbolism
### The Formal Journey
The Tendered are a priest class in the society of [[The Holyl'nds]]. Traditionally, they are taken at a young age to [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]] and raised by the Firstchurch. When they are "ready" or their training is otherwise complete, they begin their formal journey; They are ordained in filigree by their *Guardian* and ascend the 100 steps into the White Church. They are to be greeted by the Spoken of the church and given their flame. They then depart from the city in parade and glory. They will carry with them their flame where they go and tend it. Many start churches of their own and grow the flock of Patrons from the Unseen. Some settle otherwise, starting businesses, charities, or other organizations.

### The Truth
 > "The Great White Flame is not a "god" as you put it. When The Great Flame made armageddon of our holyl'nd many perished as non-believers. We are not fools. It is our master, not our god." - [[Gimish, of Firstchurch]]

[[Its Greatness]] looks upon you as you look upon it. 
Its Greatness judges you as you judge it. 
Its Greatness bestows unto you as you worship it.
Its Greatness is holy, right, and a gift to us.
We will share our gifts with the world.
