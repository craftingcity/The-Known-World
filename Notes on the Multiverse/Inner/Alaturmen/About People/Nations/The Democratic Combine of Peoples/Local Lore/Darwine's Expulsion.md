[[Darwine Evon]] formed the armies of the [[Beasts Righteous]] through some manner of great magic (see [[How the Weave becomes Magic]]?). The Azir's attempts were fruitful - he created hundreds of soldiers for a dozen roles. 

Those soldiers who were injured or otherwise could not be of use were dismissed to peruse their passions, or, more correctly; expelled from service and expected to develop one. Those who failed to adapt to their new environments were simply meant to fail - the end results of a torturous test on sentient life - and were to be afforded no harbor lest they consume resources they are not worth.

Those who have survived, most notably [[Custom Heritages#Tabaxi|Tabaxi]] and [[Custom Heritages#Kenku|Kenku]], found their way into greater Alaturmenian society and adapting to act within the neo-humanoid ecosystem.
