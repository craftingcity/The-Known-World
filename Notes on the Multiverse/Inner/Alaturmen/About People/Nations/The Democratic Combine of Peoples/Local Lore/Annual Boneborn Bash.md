	- The companies will move on before the end of the day, leaving only the locals and independents
	- The non-local merchants have significant protection or a cultist's blade
	- The fireworks show is the most popular event of the evening
- A bloodbath will open a portal from the [[Abyss]]
	- Recently the wildlands have been giving things back / acting thinner
	- Blood can act as a inter-planar connector
