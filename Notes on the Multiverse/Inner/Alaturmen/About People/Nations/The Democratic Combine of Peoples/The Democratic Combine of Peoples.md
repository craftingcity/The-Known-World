# The Democratic Combine of Peoples
![[combine-100AF.png]]
*Combine Territory as of 100AF*


## History
The Democratic Combine of Peoples is a anarchco-fiefdom government that formed at the signing of [[Coalition's Founding Document]] in 078AF. Since its founding, it has experienced thirty years of easy, calm, civil war.

## Government
The Barons of the Democratic Combine of Peoples conference often, and form their own alliances and enemies between themselves. The clauses in [[Coalition's Founding Document]] allow anyone that holds a fief (ie enough land to feed a knight) to represent the Combine in [[Communicae]].

When push comes to shove, the attitude of the Barons turn from competitor to defender - no-one hurts my sibling but me.

### Notable Factions

- The [[Knights in Red]], led by [[Baron Filip]], are a group of well meaning knights that maintain tight control of the [[Huntyr Swamp]]
- The [[Dampguard]], led by [[Baron Shimmer]], are a rich group of privateers that control much of the [[Alavini River]] – to the [[Guild of Merchants]]' chagrin.
- The [[Riphounds]] are a group of ruthless raider-knights led by the "Honorable" [[Baron Glask]] that control the [[Eastlick Mossland]] and have a "calming" rivalry with the [[Ranger's Guild]] that keep their borders.
- [[Baron Avory]] and the [[Slimknives]] control the [[Westlick Mossland]] from behind mask and shadow.
- [[Baron Havord]] founded the [[Northstone Trading Company]] in 092AF. He, and the employees and board members of the [[Northstone Trading Company]], "control" - in the loosest and most capitalist sense of the word – the [[Southern Quillbuck Jungle]], and have their base of operations, [[Quillbuck NTC]], deep in the center of the jungle.
- [[Baron Xuiop]] and their [[Beasts Righteous]] control the [[Northern Quillbuck Jungle]] and the [[Reugb Marshes]] by the rule of power.
- [[Baron Yassir Cassindil]] oversees the [[Grovetenders]] and their safekeeping of the [[Centerlick Mossland#Southern Third]].
- [[Baron Jammu]] and the [[Hillkeep Loyalists]] keep the [[Grumbling Hills]] and the [[Centerlick Mossland#Northern Third]].
- [[Five Pike]] is a group of dedicated healer-guardians of the [[Wetfoot Greenland]]. They are under the political rule of [[Baron J'Tail]], but they are the true force of power in the Wetfoots.
- The [[Centerlick Mossland#Central Third]] is controlled by the [[Baron Vannis]] and his [[Mossburg Enforcers]]. While they are praised in [[Mossburg]], the other holdings of [[Baron Vannis]] are much less pleased with the [[Mossburg Enforcers]]' work.
