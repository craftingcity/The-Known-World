# The Democratic Combine of Peoples
![[combine-100AF.png]]
*Combine Territory as of 100AF*


## History
The Democratic Combine of Peoples is a anarchco-fiefdom government that formed at the signing of [[Coalition's Founding Document]] in 078AF. Since its founding, it has experienced thirty years of easy, calm, civil war.

## Government
The Barons of the Democratic Combine of Peoples conference often, and form their own alliances and enemies between themselves. The clauses in [[Coalition's Founding Document]] allow anyone that holds a fief (ie enough land to feed a knight) to represent the Combine in [[Communicae]].

When push comes to shove, the attitude of the Barons turn from competitor to defender - no-one hurts my sibling but me.

### Notable Factions

- The [[Knights in Red]], led by [[Baron Filip]], are a group of well meaning knights that maintain tight control of the [[Huntyr Swamp]]
- The [[Dampguard]], led by [[Baron Shimmer]], are a rich group of privateers that control much of the [[Alvalini River]] – to the [[Guild of Merchants]]' chagrin.
- The [[Riphounds]] are a group of ruthless raider-knights led by the "Honorable" [[Baron Glask]] that control the [[Eastlick Mossland]] and have a "calming" rivalry with the [[Ranger's Guild]] that keep their borders.
- [[Baron Avory]] and the [[Slimknives]] control the [[Westlick Mossland]] from behind mask and shadow.
- [[Baron Havord]] founded [[Harvord Trading Company]] in 092AF. He, and the employees and board members of the [[Harvord Trading Company]], "control" - in the loosest and most capitalist sense of the word – the [[Southern Quillbuck Jungle]], and have their base of operations, the distatefully named [[New Quillbuck]], deep in the center of the jungle.
- [[Baron Xuiop]] and their [[Beasts Righteous]] control the [[Northern Quillbuck Jungle]] and the [[Reugb Marshes]] by the rule of power.
- [[Baron Yassir Cassindil]] oversees the [[Grovetenders]] and their safekeeping of the [[Southern Third]].
- [[Baron Jammu]] and the [[Hillkeep Loyalists]] keep the [[Grumbling Hills]] and the [[Northern Third]].
- [[Five Pike]] is a group of dedicated healer-guardians of the [[Wetfoot Greenland]]. They are under the political rule of [[Baron J'Tail]], but they are the true force of power in the Wetfoots.
- The [[Central Third]] is controlled by the [[Baron Vannis]] and his [[Mossburg Enforcers]]. While they are praised in [[Mossburg]], the other holdings of [[Baron Vannis]] are much less pleased with the [[Mossburg Enforcers]]' work.
## Culture
#### Heritage
The People in the Democratic Combine of People are typically Goblin, Human, Triton, or any one else. While there are a lare percentage of these people here, anyone could be found in the Combine, as anyone could find use in the Combine.
#### Language
The Combine's national language is [[Golopak (language)]], a blending of Triton and Human, with some syntax and grammar taken from Ancient Goblin and Elven.

#### Belief
Anyone can do anything in the Combine. This leads most people to have a I-mind-my-business-you-mind-yours attitude, with a dash of hope or despair, depending on who their loyal to and how their doing. 

People in the Combine respect their Barons only because the alternative is worse. The shift from one Baron to another can be clean or bloody, and it generally depends on the Baron. These people are Baron only because they can hold that position by force, somehow, because some people would take it from them by force if they could.

Many people in the Combine worship the Physical Idols as well as the Emotional Gods. The land in the Combine is a melting pot of theism as much as people.
