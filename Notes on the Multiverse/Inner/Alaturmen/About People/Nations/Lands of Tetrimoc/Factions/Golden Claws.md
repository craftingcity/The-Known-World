# Golden Claws
## History
## Governance
The public government begins with the Golden Claw Enforces; the boots on the ground. They report to their Captains at their Garrisons throughout [[The Golden City]] and the holdings under their protection. Those Captains report to [[#The Council of Eight]]. 

### The Council of Eight
The Council of Eight is the true ruling force of [[The Golden City]] and [[Lands of Tetrimoc]]. They are an oligarchy of eight people;
- [[Venclaw]]; High Ambassador / Public Control
- [[Sivir Bagwell]]; Gang Leader / Durandurm Control
- [[Ginger Ak-kizi]]; Agave Farmer / Drug Control
- [[Boris Farrinik]]; Guard Captain / Military Control
- [[]] ; High Ecologist / Fuel Control
- [[]] ; Mine Baron / Metal Control
- [[]] ; Wyvern Keeper / Wyvern Control
- [[]] ; District Manager / Wealth Control

### The Black Hand Killteams
In the bowels of the Golden City, there are many rough and tough young and unmissed children who have been indoctrinated into a secret military cult that operates outside the Deserts with extreme secrecy.

### The Golden Claw Guard
The guards of the city are the cultural superiors of all citizens of [[The Golden City]] and [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]] and their physical and lawful protectors and enforcers. Typically, guards are recruited from the upper middle class, lending precedent to the poor treatment of the lower classes throughout the south-west.
