## The Deserts of Tetrimoc

### Government of [[The Golden City]]
While many in the Golden City claim that all of the desert is ruled by [[Tetrimoc]], he has grown complacent (or simply bored), and leaves the [[The Outlands|Outlanders]] to themselves. Tetrimoc apparently controls the immediate area around the Golden City, and the [[The Outlands|Outlanders]] control the rest of the Desert, given that it has been [[Timeline|a few years]] since Tetrimoc has been seen in the city.

"Tetrimoc" rules with a golden claw; much like an iron fist, but more benevolent and more ruthless. His followers are much the same. [[The Golden City]] is a safe place to be, as it is protected by the [[Golden Claws]], but those who protect also enforce. They are called "Claws" for a reason.

The Claws also patrol around the area claimed for [[Tetrimoc]] on their war wyverns, but would not stray far from the city. They know that a band of Thieves are a mighty foe for their patrol. Generally, if a Claw does encounter a band, they both respectfully turn the other way and do something else. The Nomads get no such treatment.

### The Tournament
While the Thieves are often left to their own devices, [[The Golden City]] hosts [[Tetrimoc's Tournament of Glory]] for the most affluent class to spectate. Many Thieves come and fight for sport here, and a Thief that wins is given glorious treasure; this bounty is always enough to move the winners and their family many many classes above where they were before. This is supposedly sponsored by [[Tetrimoc]]'s horde.

### Population Distribution and Language
The desert's common is largely based on the languages of Dragons and Gnolls; draconic and abyssal respectively. This language is called [[Desertspeech (language)]].

Population distribution is as follows; one may...
- commonly find the "races of men", such as human, halflings, dwarves
- commonly find the "monstrous races", such as gnoll and "domesticated  #goblinoid"
- uncommonly find elven folk
- uncommonly find the "exotic races" such as dragonborn, goliaths, tiefling, kenku
