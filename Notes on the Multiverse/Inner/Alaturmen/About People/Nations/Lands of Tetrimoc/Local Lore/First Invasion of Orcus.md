# The Invasion of Orcus
## Written by [[Poppy Bumbleheart]]

In the eve of the first day of Still, in the 87th year after Tetrimoc had Fallen, a hum broke the sky. And all Orcus could do was smile.

Over the course of the following month, many dozens of magicians and scientists formed hypotheses about what this event was or meant, but only the Grey Ordeal knew, as the Old Man had warned only them. They traveled to the Deserts of Tetrimoc, only a half-week's ride by horseback from their Keep in Arthur's Prairie, meeting the Yellow Mage of the Guild of Wizards, in a dark and damp cave many miles north of the Golden City. His distain for his surroundings was visibly apparent in his posture and facial expression. The Yellow Mage huffed in greeting. 

"You should be glad for your Patron. Your record of employment with the Guilds would lead me to inquire about the nature of your requests if not outright deny them". He spoke with the same distain in his voice as he displayed outwardly, slithering between each word.

Tubric spoke confidently. "And yet you bring the book to us".

"And yet I do". One of the leathered hands of the mage reaches into his robe, and produces a thin book, hardbound in thick black leather, and locked by an adamantine hinge and clasp. He walks forward, and places the book into Eladrithal's grasp, who immediately passes it to Phnipper.
