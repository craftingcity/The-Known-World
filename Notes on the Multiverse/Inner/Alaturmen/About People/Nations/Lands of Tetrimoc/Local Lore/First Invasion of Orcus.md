# The Invasion of Orcus
## Written by [[Poppy Bumbleheart]]

In the eve of the first day of Still, in the 87th year after Tetrimoc had Fallen, a hum broke the sky. And all Orcus could do was smile.

Over the course of the following month, many dozens of magicians and scientists formed hypotheses about what this event was or meant, but only the Grey Ordeal knew, as the Old Man had warned only them. They traveled to the Deserts of Tetrimoc, only a half-week's ride by horseback from their Keep in Arthur's Prairie, meeting the Yellow Mage of the Guild of Wizards, in a dark and damp cave many miles north of the Golden City. His distain for his surroundings was visibly apparent in his posture and facial expression. The Yellow Mage huffed in greeting. 

"You should be glad for your Patron. Your record of employment with the Guilds would lead me to inquire about the nature of your requests if not outright deny them". He spoke with the same distain in his voice as he displayed outwardly, slithering between each word.

Tubric spoke confidently. "And yet you bring the book to us".

"And yet I do". One of the leathered hands of the mage reaches into his robe, and produces a thin book, hardbound in thick black leather, and locked by an adamantine hinge and clasp. He walks forward, and places the book into Eladrithal's grasp, who immediately passes it to Phnipper.

"Wait! Do not manage this tome lightly. The information contained herein is not to be replicated by anyone and not remembered by anyone other than yourselves." He turned to Phnipper. "Anyone."

She smiled, and quickly retorted "Got it! Is this *tome* gonna freak out when I do a magic about it?" and her smile grew cheshire in size as the Yellow Mage frowned. "I'm so glad we get to work together. Good seeing you Nicolas!"

The Yellow Mage turned from her and began to walk out of the cave before pausing to address the group.

"Do not fail your Patron." He states, before beginning to walk away again.

The smile faded from Phnipper's face, as she looked between her companions. "He said 'would' lead me to inquire. Does he really not know?"

"Aye. The Old Man was explicit, no one-" Millstone begins, before being cut off by Phnipper.

"-Needs to know until eveyone needs to know, I know, I remember. I just wish he didn't feel like he needs to keep so many secrets."

"Phnipper. We are not being tasked with keeping a secret. We are tasked with investigating the Hum. We are now one step closer, simply by holding that book within your hands. "
