The Order of Arthurian Saints is an intersectional organization that's purpose is to sanctify and induct people as Saints or Monastics. The Arthurian Saints themselves are a collection of people who have all experienced the presence, at least have claimed as such, or manifest the powers of, a physical Divine.

Generally, when people do not become a member of a chapter of [[Arthur's Knights]], they are elected to become a Monastic, serving the King outside his Kingdom by protecting and collecting knowledge in remote locales. 

The following is a list of inducted Saints in chronological order...
