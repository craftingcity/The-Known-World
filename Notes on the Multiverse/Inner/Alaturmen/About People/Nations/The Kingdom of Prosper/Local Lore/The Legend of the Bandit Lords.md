Once upon a time, many bandit families known as the [[Bandit Lords]] ruled the "civilized" cities either with an iron fist or a silver tongue.

Many were hated, but respected, as none could openly oppose them. They expanded their influence and rule, creating infighting and chaos wherever they spread.

Until [[Arthur Simonson|Artie]] lead a civil war to overthrow them, and [[Unification|unite]] the land.
