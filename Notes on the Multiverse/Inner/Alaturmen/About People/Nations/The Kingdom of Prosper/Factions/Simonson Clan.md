# Simonson Clan
## History
The Simonson clan was once a feared clan of [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Territories|blood-hobgoblin]] militants. [[Amelia Simonson]] birthed a son, [[Arthur Simonson|Artie]], and for a long time, he cared little for the politics of his home. As he returned from his days of adventuring, he found his home in ruin, his people deeply scarred. He knew it was only the fault of no-one, only the lack of a truly righteous leader. Members of the Simonsons' signatures are present on the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]], and although their clan was pushed out of power by their peers, through violence and genocide, [[Arthur Simonson]] argued that he was a legal participant in the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] and was afforded it's rights. After much litigation, and loss of life, love, and lore, the other clans agreed.
