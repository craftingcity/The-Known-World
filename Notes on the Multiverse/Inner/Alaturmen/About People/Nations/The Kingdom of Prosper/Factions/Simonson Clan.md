Legally, the Simonson clan owns all of [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]

[[Amelia Simonson]] was the matriarch before mating with a human and birthing [[Arthur Simonson]], who now heads the family eternally as he cannot age, and does not currently have children or competitors for the title.

"[[Simonson Clan]] was a band of great warriors. Matron led, nothing but family stopped them from achieving their lofty goals."
