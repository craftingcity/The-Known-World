Long ago, before the time of Unification, the Arstoviches were a family of ruthless gangster-thieves that ruled a young [[Yerba]].

They had achieved this rule because of a deal the patriarch made with the [[Witch of Ardor]].

On the turn of the half-century - after both he, the Witch, and his Son and Granddaughter had passed this plane's borders - the Witch's twisted half of her deal took effect.

The last surviving member of the Arstovich family, this patriarch's wife, was cursed with Vamparism. The first of her kind.

She too once had a name, but it has been lost to time. She is known now only by the family name. [[Arstovich]]. It still strikes fear into many a Yerban's heart.

> Rumor speaks of this woman-beast surviving her curse, wounded, but safe. 
> She has sealed herself away somewhere, guarded by her ancestor's creations. 
> With assistance, or a ***long*** rest, she would thrive again. It is only because she has been harmed that we are safe today.
