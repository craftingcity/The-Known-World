## Legends from beyond the Material Plane
> Tales of "the first goblin" do not exist, goblins have been anywhere and everywhere for as long as anything has been able to think and likely long before then.

Goblin are descendant from [[Demogorgon]] and as a species is extremely old. The tales about swimming in the soup of reality could be reasonably considered true.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Goblins are reproduce sexually, and generally have children in litters. A goblin's childhood entirely depends on where they grew up. Many goblins are able to happily survive in the wild, using their claws, teeth, eyes, and other abilities to their advantage. These same features get goblin children bullied in some "civilized" spaces.

Goblins live for about thirty years. Traditionally, goblins are raised for "the honorable death", but such a concept is clearly subjective, and as such is interpreted differently by many goblin cultures.

### Subspecies
"True" Goblins are short and gangly. Their ears suggest they may originate from the Feywild or before, and their eyes and claws are great perks in wilderness survival.

Hobgoblins are moderately sized. From a human perspective, "they are the most like us" in that hobgoblins remain calmer than their cousins.

> ##### Blood-Hobgoblin Clans
> A large population of the Hobgoblins on [[Alaturmen]] have betrayed their heritage-kin, the goblins and bugbear, and formed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Territories]]

Bugbear are the largest subspecies of goblin and the most "animalistic". Few live in "civilized" areas, but gather together to form clans and bands in the "wild". Wild-bugbear use their long limbs and strong arms to defend themselves in the wild, and those bugbear that live in civilized spaces use those same .
