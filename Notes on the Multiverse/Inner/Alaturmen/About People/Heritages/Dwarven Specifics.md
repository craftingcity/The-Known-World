## Legends from the Elves
> The old tales say the most ancient dwarves were carved by the Elves using tools given to them by their parents. 

Dwarves the descendants of Elementals, and have been formed of all elements throughout the planes, but all Alaturmen Dwarves claim their roots in the Earth.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Dwarves carve their next generation from the stone of their home. When two or more dwarves form a child, they share a deep bond. Given that dwarves have traditional humanoid sexual organs, but they do not need them to use them to reproduce, a dwarf's sexuality and gender are based more in this bond than their own body.

Dwarves do not have a childhood in the way that sexually reproducing species do. The many years that dwarves spend forming is similar to incubation more than childhood. 

Dwarves live for nearly a quarter of a millennium - usually about two-hundred and 20 years - before the curse of mortality claims them. Most believe that they pass beyond the barrier of Alaturmen and beyond the Wildlands to a place of peace in work.

### Subspecies
#### Mountain Dwarves
Many Mountain dwarves grow great beards, and keep them as both a point of pride and as a useful tool to prevent chips and dust from entering their lungs during mining.

#### Hill Dwarves
Most Hill dwarves grow beards, though most keep them short and kept, a cosmetic more than a tool, and rarely do hill dwarves grow beard lengths of more than a half-foot.
