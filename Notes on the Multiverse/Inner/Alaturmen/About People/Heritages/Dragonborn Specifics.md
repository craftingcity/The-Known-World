## Legends from the [[Immortal Dragons]]
The legends of dragons first speak of the great immortal dragons, god-like beings who grew bored of their power elected to become mortal - True Dragon - as a challenge.

The dragon made children of many, including the Dragonborn.

## Reproduction and Beyond
First generation Dragonborn are born of a True Dragon and a humanoid, but further offspring are born via sexual reproduction.

Dragonborn always inherit their humanoid parent's lifespan - a Dragonborn of Elven heritage will live much longer than one of Human heritage.

### Subspecies
Generally, the child will gather more characteristics of their carrier than their other progenitor - a dragonborn born to a true dragon may have a tail when a dragonborn born to a human or elf would not.

Dragonborn share their "bloodline" with their progenitor, meaning that their draconic powers, color, and other features align with those of their True Dragon or Dragonborn parent(s).

## Naming Convention
A Dragonborn carries their Clutch name, their Given name, and their Title. When introducing oneself to a non-dragon, one would only give their Title. To another dragonkin, it is a sign of respect to introduce oneself fully: Clutch, Given, then Title.
