# Prologue
When ==Varis== first opened his eyes, he could not see, blinded by the powerful lights and colors of his surroundings. He was warm, swaddled in blankets, but he was alone. He began to cry. Some time later, he could not determine, his cries were answered. A pair of hands pulled him from the mass of fabric, and held him close. He began to stop crying.

# Chapter One: Home
In the coming years, ==Varis==' blindness resided, as he became accustomed to his life in the Spring Courts of the Feywild. During his schooling, he was taught mathematics and language, but during his time at school, he learned of manipulation and malice. For whatever reason, his peers thought of him as an Other, and simply refused to show him kindness or decency. He survived by trick and wit alone.

In truth, ==Varis== would have hated his life if he was alone, but he was not. By his side, and he by hers, ==Amashod== was his eternal protector.
