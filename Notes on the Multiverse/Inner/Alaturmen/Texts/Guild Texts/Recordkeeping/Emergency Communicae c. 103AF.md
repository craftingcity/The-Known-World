## Forword
This is a transcript of the meeting on the 24th Day of Planting, serviced by [[Adriana Fairlin Franx]].

## CONTENT

SPEAKER: ... *unintelligible* ... Very well. Lets begin. Please calm yourselves and others around you, speakers take you stands, others, your seats. The day is the 24th of Planting. I am [[Speaker Vanavar]]. Speak.

ADV.: I am [[Filip Grundle]], I speak on behalf of [[Yyu Clipwin]] as a representative of the [[Guild of Adventurers]]. Through reputable means - the [[Kakurak|adventurer dragon]], Kakurak - we have been alerted to a force of Giantfolk marching into the territories of [[The Church of the White Flame]].

CWF: Yes; as Grundle speaks the truth. The domains of the Tendered [[Valerio Avishalom|Avishalom]], [[Caris Avner|Avner]], and [[Amirriyl Haleli|Haleli]] and their subordinates have received harsh attacks against them. The Church has been focusing on their recovery. We must act together in this time.

LOT: Skipping introductions Silvan?

CWF: Yes - my people are in danger. I have not spoken to this [[Kakurak]], but as I said, Grundle speaks true.

DCP: I am [[Srioh]]. I represent the interests of [[Baron Filip]]. It is the opinion of the [[Baron Filip]], myself, and the other [[Knights in Red]] that this is a plight we have been preparing to hear. This is the reason for founding as a Coalition, the reason we are all here to talk is to hear this call. I think I speak for all of us in this?

DCP-*: *Yelling in agreement*

LOT: I am Writh. I represent the [[Golden Claws]] as an envoy of the Golden Light, Planeblood, [[Tetrimoc]] the Progenitor. We wish it to be known that the Golden Claws will - in accordance to the written word of [[Coalition's Founding Document]] - agree and rouse army in aid of our ally. We urge others to do the same. I bring a document, signed by [[Houran Venclaw|the High Ambassador]], with a request for a meeting of war.

LOT: *steps down from the podium and across to CWF, hands them the document, returns to podium*

LOT: We are ones to keep our word.

KOP: I am [[Fraznky Bradley]], I speak for his Lordship [[Arthur Simonson]], and we too will offer our support in this time.

SPEAKER: Then the national entities are in accordance, that this is a threat of major concern?

LOT: Aye.

KOP: Aye.



CWF: Our people are still recovering from the fires. We were refugees in your arms not 30 years ago, and when we call again you answer. I thank you. My people thank you.

SPEAKER: And the Guild?

ADV.: It is the Guild's position to nip this in the bud - we can create support through volunteer groups and gold - but armies are costly, and Kakurak has performed work for the cause. Supposedly he hired a group of capable adventurers, they've been dealing with some of the major groups already. Smaller teams would be easier to move faster, and if armies really become necessary, we'd support that. Could you pass that here?

*the paper is passed*

Mhm. Okay yeah. So if we -

SPEAKER: Excuse me! I am told we are not to discuss military matters in detail here. Representative Silvan?

CWF: We will hold a council in [[Kohnstamm]] for those who would wish to attend. Please be swift with your reinforcements.

SPEAKER: With that call to arms, our time for this issue is complete. Thank you for your day.
