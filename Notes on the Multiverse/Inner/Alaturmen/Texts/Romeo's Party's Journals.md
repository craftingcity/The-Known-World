# Simone's Journal
#### Resowing 24, 105AF
Romeo asked me to come on his journey again. I think it's a really bad idea, but I would love to go with him - maybe we'd get lost somewhere in the ruins together and have to spend hours together... So I want to go, I really do. I just don't really know if the worst things I've heard have been true?

So yes. I'll tell him I'm in tonight. We are supposed to leave tomorrow, so I need to pack.

#### Resowing 25, 105AF
Okay, today's the day! We met with a few of Romeo's other friends some people he didn't know. This lady, Ghost, was like, kinda old. I thought she was someone's aunt or something before Micky said she had been to Minyostalma before, and she was going to lead us around.

We're going to enter tomorrow, we still have a bit of a ride out. I'm really excited. Romeo is too, it's so cute.

#### Resowing 26, 105AF
We're lost. Micky and I got separated from the group when these dogs wearing masks ran and jumped us. I'm so scared. This isn't what I signed up for. I want to leave. Micky is such an arrogant asshole. He says he can make our way back no problem, but I want to go back to the border for help. He says that's not a good idea.

#### Resowing 27, 105AF
We made it back before dawn. Found our way by the border lights and then just going. I miss Romeo. Like we were before. I know he's just as afraid as I am, but he's putting on a brave face for this "Ghost" lady. I hate her. I want her to take us back out.

#### Resowing 28, 105AF
She wants us going forwards, deeper into this place. Fuck. That. If shit hits the fan, I'm out.

#### Day One
Today is the 25th of Resowing, in the 105th year. Today marks the first day of my journey, and I'm writing this because I want to keep track of what I did and how I can improve. I am leaving for the Old Empire - Minyostalma. Micky says people come out of there all the time with wicked rocks and coins that they palm off for a ton of money.

We teamed up with a few of our friends, two of mine and three of his; I brought Simone and Hyndrik - but he introduced himself as "Hype" - and Micky brought Forum, Brass, and a woman calling herself "Ghost". Apparently, this lady has experience inside the Old, and I'd believe it - she's old as shit considering.

We're going to camp out a mile or so outside the walls and then bribe our way inside. Micky will drive us in under a supply wagon, and then we'll make our way east into "the Haven". From there, we kit up and make money!

#### Day Three - Part One
It is the 27th today. We have succeeded in entering the Northern Gate, Micky had the cart like he said, and we all made it through fine. The guards sounded rough. 

Once we got inside, Ghost took the lead, and started us off heading south towards the Haven. We got close by Damaged Chapel before we got chased around for the rest of the day by a group of crazed men? They ran on all fours like dogs, but they wore clothing and masks. I never got a good look at them, I was too busy running. Micky and Simone were gone for a few hours, but they came back to the Chapel by the end of the night. I was so scared.

We're in Rookie Village now. We've talked with a few folks Ghost knows, and they set us up in one of the houses here. They gave us food, water, weapons, equipment, and some weird clothing they said would keep the hidden dangers away. We are leaving for the Factory today. Ghost says that getting there will be the hardest part.
