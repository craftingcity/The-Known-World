#### Day One
Today is the 25th of Resowing, in the 105th year. Today marks the first day of my journey, and I'm writing this because I want to keep track of what I did and how I can improve. I am leaving for the Old Empire - Minyostalma. Micky says people come out of there all the time with wicked rocks and coins that they palm off for a ton of money.

We teamed up with a few of our friends, two of mine and three of his; I brought Simone and Hyndrik - but he introduced himself as "Hype" - and Micky brought Forum, Brass, and a woman calling herself "Ghost". Apparently, this lady has experience inside the Old, and I'd believe it - she's old as shit considering.

We're going to camp out a mile or so outside the walls and then bribe our way inside. Micky will drive us in under a supply wagon, and then we'll make our way east into "the Haven". From there, we Kit up and make money!
