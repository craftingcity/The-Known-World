#### Day One
Today is the 25th of Resowing, in the 105th year. Today marks the first day of my journey, and I'm writing this because I want to keep track of what I did and how I can improve. I am leaving for the Old Empire - Minyostalma. Micky says people come out of there all the time with wicked rocks and coins that they palm off for a ton of money.

We teamed up with a few of our friends, two of mine and three of his; I brought Simone and Hyndrik - but he introduced himself as "Hype" - and Micky brought Forum, Brass, and a woman calling herself "Ghost". Apparently, this lady has experience inside the Old, and I'd believe it - she's old as shit considering.

We're going to camp out a mile or so outside the walls and then bribe our way inside. Micky will drive us in under a supply wagon, and then we'll make our way east into "the Haven". From there, we kit up and make money!

#### Day Three - Part One
It is the 27th today. We have succeeded in entering the Northern Gate, Micky had the cart like he said, and we all made it through fine. The guards sounded rough. 

Once we got inside, Ghost took the lead, and started us off heading south towards the Haven. We got close by Damaged Chapel before we got chased around for the rest of the day by a group of crazed men? They ran on all fours like dogs, but they wore clothing and masks. I never got a good look at them, I was too busy running. Micky and Simone were gone for a few hours, but they came back to the Chapel by the end of the night. I was so scared.

We're in Rookie Village now. We've talked with a few folks Ghost knows, and they set us up in one of the houses here. They gave us food, water, weapons, equipment, and some weird clothing they said would keep the hidden dangers away. We are leaving for the Factory today. Ghost says that getting there will be the hardest part.
