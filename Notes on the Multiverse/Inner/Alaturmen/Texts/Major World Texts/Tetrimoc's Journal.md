# Tetrimoc's Journal

This is the true content of [[Tetrimoc]]'s journal. Any reproductions of the text herein or the tome itself have failed, producing only the "propaganda" version of the text that has been commonly distributed throughout [[Alaturmen]].

> A large tome, manifested by pure draconic radiation, bound in golden dragonhide and silver looping. It adorns no markings on its surface. Collections of notes and pages have been added to this journal over the unknowable years of its use, and all but the most recent pages have yellowed with age.

#### Year 0
I have landed here. I am injured. My tome has manifested with me as I fell. I shall rest for some time and heal my wounds. I shall dig into the desert.

#### Year 1
My lair is carved. I will expand it later, as it suits my current needs. I will sleep for a long time.

#### Year 23
The stars tell me I have been sleeping for over 20 cycles. I will survey the lands as my body heals in full. The air smells of [[Cierind]], though I know he is not close.

#### Year 25
My body is healed, and my lair is crafted. I have some bipedal creatures since in my travels, and upon my return to my lair they found me and we spoke. 

I have made myself their rightful owner. It seems that they are glad for it, some speak of "a great flame" taking their homelands. These strongest survivors are weak.

#### Year 27
The bipedal things are useful to me, they bring food and resources for me. They reach spaces I cannot. It is easy for me to cater to them, but it seems they act more and more of pest than companion.

For now I will control them, and they will continue to produce for me.

I have seen this "great flame" the small ones spoke of. It is as they say. I am not as strong as I was, I will restrict myself to the mountains and the river. The desert is my domain.
