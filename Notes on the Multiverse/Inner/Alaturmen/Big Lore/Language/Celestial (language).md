Celestial is the language of the [[Angels]] of [[Elysium]].

To all mortals, Celestial sounds like a choir of thousands singing in high tones.

To immortals or their kin, including [[Demons]], [[Devils]], [[Dragonkin]] and other [[Angels]], Celestial evokes communication rather than participates in it.
