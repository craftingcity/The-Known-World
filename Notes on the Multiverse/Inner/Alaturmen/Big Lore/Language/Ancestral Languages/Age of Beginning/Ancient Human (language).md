Ancient Human is a collection of languages formed by the first humans of Alaturmen. Even this ancient language was heavily influenced by [[Goblin (language)]], and it quickly evolved to fit it's peoples needs, birthing the modern languages of [[Desertspeech (language)]], [[High Common (language)]], [[King's Common (language)]], and [[Swampish (language)]].
