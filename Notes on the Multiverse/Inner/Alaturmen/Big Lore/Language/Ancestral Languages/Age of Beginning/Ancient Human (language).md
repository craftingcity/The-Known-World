Ancient Human is a collection of languages spoken by the first humans of Alaturmen. Quickly, these languages were forced to merge with other ancestral languages, and the languages of [[Swampish (language)]], [[Desertspeech (language)]], [[High Common (language)]], and [[King's Common (language)]] were formed. Due to their common heritage in the languages of the ancient humans, communication between these languages is possible, but stunted.
