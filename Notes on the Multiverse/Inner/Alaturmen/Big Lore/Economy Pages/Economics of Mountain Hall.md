# Mountain Hall's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
Mountain Hall is a large colony of near-isolationist Mountain Dwarves of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Suremantle]].

### Mushroom
The Bluecap mushrooms cultivated in Mountain Hall make a thick musky flour. Most citizens of Mountain hall use this to thicken their soups and stews, but Blue Bread is formed sometimes, but when compared to other "true grain" bread, is a crumbly mess of stinking powder.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Goats, Chicken, and Pig are husbanded in Mountain Hall. They are fed moss, insects, squash rinds, and other wastes. Beef is imported from the north.

#### Dairy
Goat's milk and cheese are the locally produced dairy. Eggs are produced en mass by chicken.

#### Grain
Bluecap Mushroom creates a crumbly musky flour. Other grains are imported, but they are expensive compared to Bluecap. Some people of means can consistently eat non-bluecap grains for some time, but this is unsustainable.

#### Fruit
Avocados and Almonds are grown in massive orchards, but these are the only fruit that grow in this region. Many fruits are imported from the south and the east, but these are quite expensive because of the King's tariffs.

#### Vegetable
Many types of Mushroom are grown in Mountain Hall. Squash and Cabbage are also grown here. Beans are a rotation crop and are considered acceptable as food for the people. Some vegetables are imported, but there is little demand for non-local vegetables.

#### Spice and Oil
Locally, the only available spices and oils are rock salt and avocado oil. Rock salt is mined from Mountain Hall's depths. Avocados are pressed into oil as an industry in this region. Many Oils and Spices are imported from the south. These are not as heavily tarriffed as fruit.

#### Delicacy
The prime delicacy of Mountain Hall is the chevron-bluecap kabasa. It is often served with beans, squash, and some types of mushroom and is traditionally spiced with salt, pepper, paprika, lavander, and nutmeg.

### Textiles

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
