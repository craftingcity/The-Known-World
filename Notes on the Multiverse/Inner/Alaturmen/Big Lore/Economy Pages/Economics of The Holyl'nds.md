# Holyl'nd's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The Holyl'nds were once part of a [[Great Northern Forests|large forest]] that has since [[Great Fires|burnt down]]. Now, a wasteland prospers in [[Its Greatness|It's]] glory. The Holyl'nds experience cold, wet weather patterns.

### "White" Corn
The fine silty soil of this land does not grow any grain other than a type of white maize. This is typically formed into a bread.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Cattle are a valued commodity in the Holyl'nds, both for their production of Dairy product and for their large leathers and meat. The large swaths of un-used land provide much space for ranchers to graze in.

#### Dairy
The largest dairy in this area is cow's milk. Cheese and butter are created from it and spread throughout Alaturmen.

#### Grain
While some grains can be found in import, the only grain that grows in this area is "Great Maize", a white variant of traditional corn / maize. The flavor is blander than its more colored cousin, but beggars cannot be choosers.

#### Fruit
Very few fruits will survive the soil in this area. The two most consumed fruits in this area are avocado and pear, both of which survive in the soil of the Holyl'nds. "Great Tomatoes" are cultivated in this area, but their fruit grow to be grey and saggy.

#### Vegetable
Lettuce, Cabbage, and Squash perform well in the soil in this area. Beans are a rotation crop, and it is generally considered animal's food, but certain dishes such as some stews or salads they are essential in.

#### Spice and Oil
#### Delicacy

### Vices
What do people do for *fun*?

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
