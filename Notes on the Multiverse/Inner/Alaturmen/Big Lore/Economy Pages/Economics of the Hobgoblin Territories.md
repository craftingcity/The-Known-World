# Territories of the Northeastern Hobgoblin Clans' Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The area of the Hobgoblin Territories is largely forested. It is cold and rainy in this area. 

### Pemmican
The people of the Territories most commonly consume a combination of powdered fruits, meats, and fats. This paste-like dish keeps for long periods of time and can be created with simple ingredients.

### Food
Most clans in the Territories participate in nomadic hunter-gather behavior, and prefer to cultivate crops and livestock through manipulation rather than "traditional" farming.

#### Meat
The most common meat is game by a large degree. Rabbit and Deer are the most common of the common. Cattle is hard to manage in the denser parts of the forest, so Goats are a much more common farm animal.

#### Dairy
Goat's milk and cheese are the only true dairy produced in this region. Some clans press almonds and create a milk-like-substance in this manner. Eggs are harvested as forage from wild birds.

#### Grain
Barley grows in small wild patches in this region. Some clans process heart-nuts and almonds into a flour, and this makes a fine alternative when grain is necessary.

#### Fruit
Apple, Pear, and Cherries grow in abundance in the dense forests of this region. Heart-nut and Almond trees also grow wild here. All of these fruit trees are cultivated into orchards by clans through years of manipulation.

#### Vegetable
Carrots, Potatoes, Turnips, Yams, and Squash all grow well in this region and are commonly gathered by many clans of the Territories.

Animals of the region are fed on grass and shrubbery.

#### Spice and Oil
Mint and Parsley grow well in the shade, as well as the common roots of Garlic and Onion.

Beets grow wild in the deeper parts of the forest, and are almost always used as a sweetener either as whole or in sugar. Honey is as rare as beets, and just as about as hard to correctly harvest for its sweet juices.

Nut oils and milks are made, but considered poor replacements for goat or cow's butter. Rarely, "true" Oils from the City in Gold make their way into the territories and are highly valued.

#### Delicacy
Beef and Cow's dairy are highly prized, along with White flour products. Good oils and spices are hard to come by in this area.

### Vices
The Clans of the Territories gather for Festivals and Gladiatorial Combat when at peace. The hard drinks of fruit are prized in this area, beer less, but acceptably so. Tobacco has been cultivated here for years, and Cannabis is cheaply imported from the south-west.

Smokebulb grows rarely in this region, and is a highly desired ritual medicine in the here.

### Land
The Clans of the Territories fight eachother for their land. If they can take land by force, a Mangugu would attempt to do so, for the prosperity of their clan. 

### Overhead
Because there is no greater collective of the Clans, other than the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]], taxes are always in the form of community service to the local Mangugu. Most folks live in these semi-nomadic clans, but well established clans often have more permanent structures if they believe that they can be defended. Production processes, if they can be permanent and defended, can be large, but otherwise, are generally small and personal.

### Cutting Corners
When times are very tough, the people of the Territories know that they are not above eating the meat of their own fallen. Neither Humanoid or Goblinoid is an *acceptable* meat, but when there is no other alternative for you, your Clan, your Clan's goats, the people you just felled for their farmland are still fresh meat. Generally, this is unnecessary, the forests provide.

Butter is a necessity of life in the Territories, most people make it on their own, during travel. If survival is key, forgoing even the simplest spices of onion and mint would stretch a Clan's budget.

### Middlemen
Trade between peaced Clans are common enough to consider their economy together as we do, and most "merchants" work directly under their Mangugu to maintain certainty of inventory. Festival markets are quickly mobilized gatherings of dealers and muscle, in constant preparation for an assault. 

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

Most crafts are passed through familial tale, and while this structure does maintain a monopoly on knowledge, it is quite fragile. Specialists learn from mentors of their clans.

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

Leather and Hides are commonly worn during the warmer seasons. Winter clothing is most often lined in furs or knitted of hemp, or both. Linen and Silk are rarities in this region, and denote foreign wealth.

### Preservation
Most meat and fruits are turned into pemmican. Some meats become salted, some fruits become jellies or spreads, but it is simply the most effective use of the materials caloric.

### Containers
People store things in leather and hide bags. Possessions must be packed when not in use, so belts with pouches and bags are common accessories. Some permanent settlements contain perishables in ceramic dishes, but only for limited times, and never for transport.

### Mining
Copper and Lead can be mined here. There are few mining operations in this area, as most metals can be cheaply imported from the west.

### Magic / Technology
The people of the Territories experience magic in religion. Shamans preach knowledge and can heal or harm with only a touch. People attempt to buy magical power from otherworldly beings through cults and rituals.

The Technology of the region is sub-par, as research cannot be performed well in non-permanent structures or warring conditions. Magically powered mild temperature controls such as heaters and coolers are accessible in this region.
