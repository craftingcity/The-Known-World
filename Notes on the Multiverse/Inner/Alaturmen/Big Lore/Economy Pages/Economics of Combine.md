# The Democratic Combine of People's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
While each state of Combines varies in their favors and productions, this page paints the broad strokes of the Combine's economy.

Combine is a warm and wet place, magically infused with ancient elven and druidic magics.

### Rice
Rice! Gods bless Rice! On its own, sauced, in risotto, sushi, pudding, so many dishes!

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Fish is the most common meat in the combine. Crab and Shellfish are uncommon, but still accessible. Many people cultivate farms of bugs for many reasons, including as food, bait, spice, and dye.

Folks husband Goats and Pig in the wetlands of Combines, as well fowl such as Ducks and Geese. Some very power people husband cattle as well, but this is a difficult and expensive task here.

#### Dairy
Goats are prized possessions for the families of Combine, and the same is true of Cattle and the lords. While both true dairies and alternatives - such as walnut or imported almond - are available Cow's milk is most desired, and alternatives to Goat are less desirable and expensive.

#### Grain
Rice is *the* grain of the Combines. No other grain is really desired or grown here, except perhaps for the sake of variety in luxury.

Fine white flour is imported for certain delicacies, but most folk enjoy the taste of their home-grown grain.

#### Fruit
Citrus, Plum, Peach, Pear, Cherries, Tomatoes, Papaya, Mango, and many other warm growing fruits are prosperous in this area. These myriad of fruits are dried, salted, and preserved throughout the Combine.

#### Vegetable
Skunk Weed, Water Spinach, Water Caltrop, Taro, Lotus, Cattail are few of the many Stinky, Leafy, Starchy vegetables that grow in the Combine. Vegetable soups are a common and *acquired* taste, especially when spiced poorly.

Summer Squashes do well in the heat of Combine.

Marigold and Catnip are worth mentioning as they do appear in most gardens in the Combine, but not as a consumable or a spice, but rather a repellent and an attractant. Wild cats are culturally considered good luck, and well tended ones may even provide minor gifts or service.

Animals are fed with rinds from melons and squashes, or with peas or poor spinach.

#### Spice and Oil
Jasmine, Water-Pepper, Wasabi, Basil, and Sage all grow well in the warmer wetter conditions of Combine. 

Lemongrass often appears as a garnish and a tea in the Combine.

Olive and Almond oils are imported from the West bank of the [[Alavini River]] for relatively cheap, and most middle class families could access them for their everyday meals.

Poorer oils such as Heart-nut are imported from the north, but the common folk have little choice but goat butter or some type of lard for their oil.

#### Delicacy
Sweet rice cake are a wonderful treat, but the best dish a middle class family could ask for is sweet-and-sour beef with vegetable noodle and rice.

Nobles import white flour for some pastries and other fine dishes, but these are reserved for occasion to all but the richest of citizens.

### Vices
Some of the best alcohols known to Alaturmen come from the Combine's distilleries, and many fall to the vice Lush in this fertile land. From the north, Smokebulb, Cannabis, and Tobacco are imported in droves to Combine.

As with all Alaturmen, the brothels here are under the protection of the [[Guild of Merchants#Yáramólë]].

### Land
In a very similar manner to their neighbors in the North, citizens of Combine pay their local lord, who fights others for their lands and goods. When citizens purchase land from a lord, they become lords of that land, which lends itself quite well to rents and leases for those that would rather not play the game. When a contract of that nature is signed, it is with the Current and All Future Barons. This is respected, assuming that Future Baron doesn't want their citizens to buy them out, leave, or revolt.

Most land is very wet and fertile in Combine.

### Overhead
The citizens of Combine pay extreme taxes to their Current Baron. Many tax collectors attempt to take one of three under order of the Baron, but established Barons collect thinner fees, one of five or six. 

Many citizens of Combine are quite strong, and their labor is highly valued in farms and transportation companies. Many people hire Goliath or Bugbear to do the labor that a typical work animal would perform.

All of the buildings in this area are reinforced against water damage and many are on stilts above the waterlines. Boardwalks and bridges make inter-building travel easy. All builds of production have heavy roofs.

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
