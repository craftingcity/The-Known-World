# Prosper's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The Kingdom of Prosper controls what was the [[Bandit Lords]]' territory, which is majorly farmland, and otherwise fairly forested. While it is not itself rich in resources, Prosper's relationship with Actstow allows for them to be rich in metals and other precious materials. Magic does not impact the everyday life of a citizen of Prosper. The Kingdom is a medium, less-than temperate region. It experiences mild rains.

### Bread
Rye is the common bread.

White flour is better served making other foods than bread, such as cakes and muffins and jelly pastries and the like - a mild delicacy, one might say.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Cattle are kept on large ranches in cities and villages, but herding and keeping cattle farther from civilization quickly becomes impossible, leading these people to use goats instead. Rabbit are also a commonly kept farm animal in this region.

The forests of Prosper are populated by deer, turkey, goose, pig and smaller animals like rabbits, raccoon, and rodents. Most game is considered commoner's meat, because it's cheap, available, and not great! Fowl and Chevron reside a step above game, but Pork and Beef are leagues of their own.

#### Dairy
Both goat and cow milk and cheese are available, but cows are both harder to maintain and more desirable, so they generally cost more than the goat alternative.

#### Grain
Rye is a powerful taste. One that Prosper is used to, but Wheat makes its way into the middle-class diet too. Nuts are not particularly common to this region, but some acorns and heart-nuts are found in this region and turned into cheap flour.

#### Fruit
Apples and Pears are common wild trees, and make good drinks, both sweet and hard. Berries are less common, but still grow well in the region, making most more pricey than the other fruits, but Citrus reigns supreme in rarity, as it does not grow at all in this less than temperate weather.

#### Vegetable
Beans, Carrots, Cabbage, Oats, Pumpkin, and Winter Squash are food of the common. People generally make many soups in this region, and while this is the cultural norm, it is also considered an intelligent and practical choice. Typically, these meals are also spiced with local forage, such as mushrooms or dandelion.

Animals are to be fed hay, corn, or potato. 

#### Spice and Oil
The spices grown here are from here are mostly roots such as garlic, ginger, and onion. Mint and Parsley grow well in the area. Applesugar is cheap to make, weak in sweetening, and distinct in flavor. Most farmers can make it at home. Honey is a more expensive option, it trades being common and skilless for being actually good. Cinnamon is imported steadily from the south, and it is considered a lower-middle class commonality (and necessity, if using Applesugar).

Cow butter is generally reserved for special occasion and Goat Butter used in everyday cooking. Good Oils are expensive, as they must be transported from the City in Gold, but "cheaper" (although only from lack of demand), more distasteful options are available in heart-nut oil and seed oil.

#### Delicacy
Because Prosper is in a powerful trade position, the available delicacies are from almost every culture in Alaturmen. Anyone wanting to put on a show would have personally traveled to collect another region's delicacy and brought it back, but your personal assistant would do as well.

### Vices
Brothels in all Alaturmen are represented by the [[Guild of Merchants#Yáramólë]], should they chose to be.

Many farmers grow Cannabis and Tobacco alongside their other fibers and dry them at home. These are one of Prosper's few exports to the world trade.

### Land
Land is "owned" by the King, but he grants management to his nobles, who rent their land to commoners. The nobles are responsible for the upkeep of public works on their managed land, and the King often holds Common Court by lottery at festivals to check in with his citizenry.

Temples to all of the [[Grand Pantheon#Emotional Gods]] can be found in Prosper, and larger cities have multiple temples. Prosper is the Domain of the Idol Ventan, and he is worshiped in the [[Circle of Ventan]].

Lands closer to Castle Prosper or Coalition City are considered much more valuable, as they are better protected. The best of the King's fields grow Barley.

### Overhead
In outskirt homesteads and villages, there are no ways of refrigerating food, but in larger villages and cities, iceboxes are maintained by journeymen mages. Most folk carry a self-defense weapon, and most family have at least one bow and set of arrows for hunting. Horses are the most common working animal in this region, although some folks hire bugbear instead of keeping a work animal. 

Often, in addition to the "average", farms in Prosper have dairy working sheds, drying sheds, and outbuildings for fuel storage.

The king's tax is one-twelfth to the army, one-eleventh to the poor, and one-thirteenth to the nobility. To enforce this law, the king hires tax-collectors capable of detecting lies with certainty and striking with power – ie with magical means. These tax collectors are respected more than feared to the honest folk of Prosper.

### Cutting Corners
The people of Prosper are practical, they eat cheap grains and meats in cheap dishes. Most people make their own clothes and grow their own spices, or can get them in trade with a neighbor on the cheap. Few people are unwilling to help another – they "do as the King would do".

### Middlemen
Prosper is positioned in the second best position for trade, lagging only slightly behind the prime real estate that is Coalition City, and it has established trade roads, meaning that cities have huge marketplaces of products from around Alaturmen. Often, a commoner can buy a small collection of novel spices for a season alongside their staples at festival markets.

Merchants are generally considered leeches, and people of Prosper prefer to buy from the source or as close to it as possible. The Guild of Merchants has some power here, but considerably less than it does in other regions. The people of would like things to stay the way they are instead of paying seemingly unnecessary fees for "transportation" or false "luxury".

### Craftsmen
The Guilds of Coalition City have their fingers in many pies, and are well represented in Prosper. While there are some non-members all over Alaturmen, the Guilds have good control over the value of crafts in Prosper. Most goods and services can be found in cities, and some specialists can find enough work in the larger villages of the region.

The Guild's representatives look for peers of the caliber required and bring them into the fold. The knowledge for the technology required to build certain objects such as specialized rods or legs have been hidden by the Guild to maintain control. While its theoretically possible that one could build such a thing themselves, the Guild's reach of resources and power also allows them to control how this technology spreads.

Guilded Craftsmen generally request 50/50 timed charging based on how long they believe the project to take at the level of quality requested, according to the Guild's value of these things, of course.

### Textiles
People in Prosper wear mostly for furs or goat-wool. Leather is more useful as things other than clothing. Canvas is more common than Linen, and much more common than the luxury import Silk.

The berries of the region make warm and cool dyes, but not very poppy ones. The people of Prosper have little demand for imported dye other than the coveted White or Black.

### Preservation
There are few sources of salt in Prosper, although it is imported from both Combine and Acstow. Applesugar is fairly weak and distinctly flavored compared to other sources, but can still be used in preservatives. Cheese pairs well with Meat, Beer and other imported spirits. Vegetables are typically pickled with apple vinegar, lending them a strong flavor. Fruit preserves and other vegetables are sometimes canned in glass or metal cans.

### Containers
Baskets and Bags are the most common transportation mediums, although barrels and boxes are still used in large operations. The pottery of the region is generally poor, and most folk import their pottery when they can.

### Mining
Prosper primarily trades with Acstow for their mining materials, although some specialties such as gems they buy from the south. While there are some mines in Prosper, with such powerful operations nearby, it's often cheaper to import than produce.

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?

Prosper has access to most alchemical components, leading to a large alchemical industry in Prosper. The city of Magius holds an academy, and some of its most talented graduates work for the government as mages of war or as enchanters and artificers for their specialized needs.

Some wealthy sections of cities have wind-powered-aquafirs and most mills are powered by the wind as well.

### Other Notes
- Prosper's people are generally well educated, practical, and hard working. 
- The people of Prosper are typically not institutionally religious, they are community focused culturally.
