# The Guilds
The guilds function as the "federal government", as such that they enforce general practices across the peaceful lands that they can access.

#### Rangers
The members of the [[Ranger's Guild]] keep [[The Planes of Existence]] at bay. This is their main function. Some see The Rangers as a more stagnant reflection of the Adventurers Guild, acting like State Police or Forestry Service more than something like FBI.

#### Wizards
Keepers of knowledge and grand secrets, this is the NSA/NASA operation. Mostly deals in licensing wizards and academies, and setting the laws of acceptable practice. They also work with the [[Guild of Crafters]] to dispense (or hide) public knowledge. See [[Guild of Wizards]] for a more detailed agenda.

#### Merchants
The [[Guild of Merchants]] deals directly with the economics of the nations of the world. They see to exchange rates, production and transportation costs, and monitoring the flow (or lack thereof) of necessities such as food, water, and medicine from one nation to another.

##### Thieves
While many folks disavow that [[The Thieves Guild]] even exists, it does. An extension branch of the [[Guild of Merchants]] that outlines fair practices between thieves and other classes of crooks (such as assassins :D ). A bureaucracy doles out tasks to those members. 

Much like the Adventurers guild, the Thieves Guild keeps independent crooks from causing too much unsanctioned trouble. The thieves guild has a more difficult time of it however, as its power is quite small compared to the other guilds, and often can only step in by absorbing and changing or obliterating existing criminal powers.

#### Craftsfolk
The [[Guild of Crafters]] are the federal union. They work with the Merchant's guild hand in hand to deal with supply and demand, as well as funding for larger projects such as road maintenance, city building, etc.

#### Adventurers
This is the guild the players will likely interact with the most. 

When someone needs a job done that doesn't fit into another Guild's forte, the [[Guild of Adventurers]] pick it up. An enforcement system for big bads and stuff, as well as keeping "unlicensed" adventurers from doing much harm. Keep the Murderhobos out and away to make peace and civilization as easy as can be.


# Intra-Guild
The Grand Guild, or Guild of Guilds, runs the other guilds. Internal Affairs, so to speak.

A council of representatives from each nation and each guild communicate to run the Guilds as smoothly as possible. This is known as [[Communicae]], and happens twice a year. The structure of the guilds are such that the Guild Proper does little but set the guilds into motion and course correct via bureaucracy when necessary. A responsibility of the Grand Guild, in conjunction with the [[Guild of Wizards]], is to record keep.
