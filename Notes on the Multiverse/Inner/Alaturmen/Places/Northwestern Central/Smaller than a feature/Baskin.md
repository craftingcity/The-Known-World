# Description
Any sort of local lore...

## Physicality of the Holding
Baskin was recently attacked by a raid of Ice Giants (see [[The Assault of the Giant Decenters]]). Its stone buildings are deteriorating and rubbled, and what were once wooden structures are now piles of ash and scrap.

## Population Distribution
A large population of Orc live here, and the Grand Tendered is a green dragonborn, this leads the city to be quite exotic in comparison.
