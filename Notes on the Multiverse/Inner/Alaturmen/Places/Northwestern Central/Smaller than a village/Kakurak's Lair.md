# Kakurak's Lair

The Adult Bronze dragon Kakurak (120 years) lives in a wet cave edged to the [[Firelight Sea]] in the [[The Holyl'nds|Lands of the Great White Flame]]. He keeps a satyr druid Marcus as his servant and companion, and tasks himself with protecting the people of the Known World.

1. Cave Enterence

Its the entrance to his cave lair! The lake outside makes it wet in this room, and the floor is slick with slime and water. A large opening leads to the main hall.

2. Main Hall

Each of the other rooms in this Lair are connected to this main chamber, either by long corridors or simple openings. This room is much drier, largely because of the massive white bondfire in the center of the room inset into the floor. To any that look with intent to the fire, it looks back.

3. Marcus' Room

Marcus lives in a large 30' circular chamber. He has a large bed of wet moss, a beautifully carved set of wooden dining furniture (where he and Kakurak will often share meals), a dresser, natural carved shelf (upon which he keeps his few trinkets of home and mementos of his life past).

3A. Marcus' Kitchen

Attached to Marcus' room, a kitchenette and a storage room for food.

4. Artifact Hall

The door to this room is a thick lead, and has two locks (of DC 25).

In this large rectangular hall, lead plates cover the carved space here. Dark steel pedistals stand around the room. Three have items upon them. 

- An *indestructability generator*. This small circular plate looks to be made of iron and is the size of a small coin. It bares no features. When held to something and its command word spoken, the plate attatches to the item and creates a thin field of dense Weave, bestowing the following affects; the item's AC is raised by 10 or set to 20, whichever is higher. If attatched to a set of armor, the armor gains a +4 bonus in addition to any other enchantments.
- A *necklace of compulsion*. A silver chain adorns a small locket. The locket has no latch, and cannot be forced open until the item is innert. The images inside are of many thousand small horrible faces. Anyone who wears the necklace becomes attatched to whomsoever speaks the command word of the necklace and would follow their will as if it was their own. Once attuned, there is no saving throw.
- A *ring of false wishes*. This golden ring grants its wearer three wishes. Once the three charges have been expended the ring falls off its wearer's hand and cannot be worn by them again. Those wishes are then turned upon their wisher, generally resulting in horrible mayhem. 
 
 5. Treasure Room / Kakurak's Lair

Kakurak keeps this room well sorted, with each type of item having its own space. In the center of the room Kakurak sleeps on a large pile of coins and gems and loose jewelry.

All of the items in this room are of overwhelming value.

Many magical scrolls and magical gems are stuffed and sorted in shelves and racks that line the northern wall of this room. Weapons and armor of beautiful craft are placed on racks in the east and west.

Among the rest, an *alchemy jug*, an *amulet of the planes*, a *plate mail of invulnerability*, a *hide armor of cold resistance*, a *belt of dwarven-kind*, a *belt of frost giant strength*, a pair of *boots of elven-kind*, a pair of *boots of striding and springing*, a *cape of the mountebank*, a *dragon-slayer shortsword*, an *elven chain shirt*, a pair of *gauntlets of ogre power*, a *hammer of thunderbolts*, a *helm of teleportation*, a *mace of smiting*, a *mantle of spell resistance*, a *+2 spell focus*.

6. Kakurak's Study

In his study, many bookshelves hold tomes of knowledge. A formidable collection. A pair of armchairs flank a fireplace and a small table with a decanter and two glasses. In the northeastern corner of the room, a marble table holds a *crystal ball of true seeing, mind reading, and identifying*. On a raised pedestal in the center of the room a carved and black-with-gold-speckles chalked *teleportation circle* lies.

7. Guests Quarters

This room is kept in good array, and contains humanoid bedding for up to six.
