### Scenarios
- R13. Statue of a Dying Warrior 
	- A massive statue depicts a human warrior wielding a shield and sword clad entirely in plate-mail flailing upwards, as if pulled off their feet and into the air, and impaled by an equally massive obelisk piecing their body and armor in a visually harrowing artistic competence. Both the statue and the obelisk are made of a bright white fire-light. The obelisk is inscribed in Ancient Elvish with the repeating phrase ("**Ustafána. Amimirn vala, cenvéla amursanya. Pustame cenai lertatye, anatnye neithanata. **"/"Burn. I am their god, let my anger be known. Stop me if you can, but I will never be slighted again. To the young; Burn your kin on my stakes, bring me their souls, and then soil your sister's husband. Burn." )
