#### A sub-region of {Greater Region}
## Boundaries
## Contents
### Flora
### Scenarios
- H4. Broken Markings of [[Sylas, Winter Monarch]]
	- A large in-earth marking has been ruined. The remaining stones are carved with script ([[Sylvan (language)]]) that impresses a religious use, but little detail can be gleaned. The wear of the script on the stones also suggests that this marking is old; these stones were considered worn long before they were broken.  
- I2. Reality Acid
