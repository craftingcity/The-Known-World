### The Monsters...

#### The Cancer
> *'To an undiscerning eye, the Cancer looks to be simply an obese hog, but this is not the case. The Cancer's squat and portly seeming legs expand to sharp long claws, the juicy pork of the beast is marked with boils and tumors, and it's stout face is clipped back to a gross dripping maw.'*

#### The Demon
> '*A horrible black beast lurks the Grey Forest. Survivor's rumors claim it's hide is impenetrable, and it's claws and teeth sharper than any blade. It is unkillable, impossible to track, and kills you and your party before you've noticed it's there.*'
Medium Monstrosity;
xx AC, xx HP

#### The Freak
> '*This creature was clearly once a humanoid. It wears a mask and clothing appropriate for the dangers of Minyostalma, but it has clearly changed. Crawling on all fours, mouth agape below its mask, the Freak is a horrible sight.*'
Medium Monstrosity;
xx AC, xx HP

#### The Hidden Men
> '*Rumors of small stout men with telekinetic abilities unmarred by the air of the Old riddle the journals of dead scavs, some as silly as men dying to flung tins of beans, but few believe that these creatures exist. They do, and flying foods is the least of a Scavs concerns.*'
Small Humanoid;
xx AC, xx HP

#### The Jumper
> '*A fishlike creature standing on four legs stands and screams before leaping through the air with incredible speed. The Jumper specializes in hit-and-run tactics to hunt individual targets of opportunity.*'
Medium Monstrosity;
xx AC, xx HP

#### The Mass
> '*Sickening thuds accompany the Mass' movements throughout Minyostalma. To call it a great beast is an understatement, for lack of a better descriptor, this horrible face on legs is giant.*'
Large Monstrosity;
xx AC, xx HP

#### The Warper
> '*We think it was once a man. It looks the part. The elongated limbs, sharp claws for fingers, bloody tendrils for a mouth, and above all else the camouflage this monster uses makes that theory less than likely. Or one hell of a man to start.*'
Medium Humanoid;
xx AC, xx HP

#### The Zombies
> '*Lost scavs and missing comrades, the Zombies within the walls of Minyostalma were once our friends. Our relatives. Lost to the storms of light. It is a disgrace to leave these facades alive.*'
Medium Undead;
xx AC, xx HP
