## The Places...
Each of the following locations describe the contents of the singular hex-mile they are contained within (excepting the City and Village, which are two and three hex-miles respectively, and are still described below). 

### The Cordon
This region of the Old is known as the Cordon. [[#White-Flame Militants]] hold the majority of this area, and uses this outpost to supply and command operations within the Old performed by these soldiers. 

#### The Western Entrance
The Western Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Western Entrance are exclusively to prevent unidentified persons from exiting the Old.

Entering this gate leads directly to the area within the Cordon known as the Reserve.

#### The Recreations Camp
The Recreation Camp is directly north of the Reserve. The WFM in the area use the Recreations Camp to relieve the stress of operating within the Old.

Alongside physical recreation games, such as ringtoss or kickball, there are small cabins for warmth, table games, drug use, and sexual recreation.

#### The Killing Fields
The Killing Fields are directly north of the Depot. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old. 

The name "Killing Fields" was given to this area of their perimeter due to the number of Scavs that attempt to breach the Cordon from the north.

#### The Mudhouse
northeast of the Depot

#### The Reserve
A series of large tents and semi-permanent structures form a small military town. WFM use the Reserve and the surrounding areas as their primary base of operations within the Old.

Trails lead from the Reserve throughout the Cordon, connecting the dispret settlements into one grander area.

#### The Depot
The largest and most-well protected area within the Cordon, the Depot is a warehouse used by the WFM as storage for their resources and equipment that is exclusively for WFM members only. It is located east of the Reserve, and west of the Hunting Slots.

#### The Hunting Slots
The Hunting Slots are directly east of the Depot. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old. 

The name "Hunting Slots" was given to this area of their perimeter due to the number of natural mutant threats that attempt to breach the Cordon from the east. Much of the food supply the WFM eat comes from these mutants.

### The Haven

#### The Northern Entrance
The Northern Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Northern Entrance include both allowing entrants for a fee and disallowing, by fire and force, any unidentified persons from exiting.

Entering this gate leads into the Broken Swamps, where a small trail leads to the Rookie Village and the Haven at large.
