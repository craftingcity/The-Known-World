# The Places...
Each of the following locations describe the contents of the singular hex-mile they are contained within (excepting the City and Village, which are two and three hex-miles respectively, and are still described below). 

## The Cordon
#### The Western Entrance
The Western Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Western Entrance are exclusively to prevent unidentified persons from exiting the Old.

Entering this gate leads directly to the area within the Cordon known as the Reserve.

#### The Recreations Camp
The Recreation Camp is directly north of [[#The Reserve]]. The WFM in the area use the Recreations Camp to relieve the stress of operating within the Old.

Alongside physical recreation games, such as ringtoss or kickball, there are small cabins for warmth, table games, drug use, and sexual recreation.

#### The Killing Fields
The Killing Fields are directly north of [[#The Depot]]. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old. 

The name "Killing Fields" was given to this area of their perimeter due to the number of Scavs that attempt to breach the Cordon from the north.

#### The Mudhouse
Northeast of the Depot, a mudbrick outhousehouse stands out as a lone survivor amidst the desolation surrounding it. Surrounding the outhouse are the ruins of other abandoned structures, their walls crumbling, serving as eerie reminders of a home long lost.

#### The Reserve
A series of large tents and semi-permanent structures form a small military town. WFM use the Reserve and the surrounding areas as their primary base of operations within the Old.

Trails lead from the Reserve throughout the Cordon, connecting the dispirit settlements into one grander area.

#### The Depot
The largest and most-well protected area within the Cordon, the Depot is a warehouse used by the WFM as storage for their resources and equipment that is exclusively for WFM members only. It is located east of [[#The Reserve]], and west of [[#The Hunting Slots]].

#### The Hunting Slots
The Hunting Slots are directly east of [[#The Depot]]. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old. 

The name "Hunting Slots" was given to this area of their perimeter due to the number of natural mutant threats that attempt to breach the Cordon from the east. Much of the food supply the WFM eat comes from these mutants.

#### The Barracks
The sparse activity within the Reserve continues south into the Barracks. This area stands in stark contrast to [[#The Recreations Camp]] for it's somber air. Made of bare walls surely reinforced by layers of metal and mortar, the Barracks are used exclusively for sleep and the storage of personal accoutrement. 

#### The Training Grounds
South of [[#The Depot]] and East of [[#The Barracks]], the Training Grounds is an area filled with obstacles, shooting ranges, and combat simulations to hone and test the skills of both new recruits and veterans.

#### The Forward Post
South-east of [[#The Depot]], a single rusting metal watch-tower serves as lookout for the surrounding tents and reinforced ruins. The soldiers stationed here know that they are the first line of defense against anything that Minyostalma will throw at them.



## The Haven
#### The Northern Entrance
The Northern Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Northern Entrance include both allowing entrants for a fee and disallowing, by fire and force, any unidentified persons from exiting.

Entering this gate leads into [[#The Damaged Chapel]], where a small trail leads to [[#The Rookie Village]] and eventually the Haven at large.

#### The Rookie Village
The so-called "Rookie Village" was - at one point - a small hunting settlement by the name of Belthaenne, but it is now occupied by a number of generally unaffiliated Seekers and is managed by a negligently profitable Goliath merchant who calls himself [[Ondo]].

A thin trail connects the Rookie Village to [[#The Damaged Chapel]] to the east and to [[#The Levee]] to the south. 

#### The Damaged Chapel
Standing west of [[#The Rookie Village]], Damaged Chapel is a small compound of a main Chapel, a small Barracks, and a series of mausoleums throughout a large yard of marked graves. 

The Chapel itself is quite badly damaged, as the supporting structures of the second story have failed and caused the roof of the building to partially collapse inward - thus the name. The battles that have taken place within the building surely do not help either. Under scrutiny of the surviving religious images, two things can be known;
	- The text is [[Sylvan (language)]], and the images depict a bountiful land of nature.
	- The god worshipped here is named [[Kor-ket]], and a repeating motif is "All this is made to be yours to do what you will."

The graveyard is largely uninteresting to those who care little for the names of dead souls, but the mausoleums that scatter throughout are more interesting - once used by the resting dead, they are now used as small shelters, storage areas, and military defenses (see Embrasure).

A thin trail travels from the front door of the chapel westward towards and into [[#The Rookie Village]].

#### The Lone Farmstead
North of [[#The Rookie Checkpoint]], the Lone Farmstead was once an important economic feature of the growing empire. Much of the land to the Farmstead's west is now abandoned and overgrown farmland. The Farmstead itself consists of a collection of three buildings, and two ancient objects.

On the Farmstead, a small house of three rooms has been long looted of useful material. Across a small clearing, a decrepit wooden barn creaks and groans, threatening to break down at any moment in the wind. Standing tall and strong between the two other buildings on the clearing, a large stone granary and mill acts as the most defensible building on the compound.

The ancient objects seem dangerous. A curious mind would likely identify the many wheels on frame as an ancient iteration of a simple cart, but the mystery lies in its purpose and power source. 

#### The Levee (1d6 RAD)
South of [[#The Rookie Village]], a large field of dead plants and puddles separates the people in the North from the dangers of [[#The Toxic Swamps]]. No Minyostalman structures are present here, and rather the area is named for the ditch of rubble constructed and maintained by the Rookies.

#### The Crossroads
West of [[#The Rookie Checkpoint]], a large plate of white rock forms a plus symbol on the face of the earth. At the center of this large rock crossroad, on the south-eastern side, a thin pole of this white rock emerges from the ground. Clearly broken, this pole is a sharp hazard - so much so that a corpse of a Scav is lying impaled around the pole.

#### The Rookie Checkpoint
East of [[#The Crossroads]], a large fence has been erected between [[#The Haven]] and [[#The Sticks]]. It is most commonly occupied by a number of Scavs working for [[Ondo]], defending the Haven at large from the Bandits in [[#The Sticks]].

#### The Toxic Swamps (2d6 RAD)
The land south of [[#The Levee]] is the most dangerous space within [[#The Haven]]. Deep puddles of toxic irradiated water cover most of the surface within this area, were one wrong step can lead to entrapment and a slow painful death.

Continuing south or west will lead into the [[#Broken Swamps]] and then [[#The Cordon]] beyond it.

#### The Flea Market
South of [[#The Crossroads]] and east of [[#The Levee]] stands a large crumbled building known as the "Flea Market". 

What was once the ground floor has crumbled to its supports. Those few rooms that are not impassable are derelict, and devoid of occupants.

Taking the stairs from within the building or the makeshift ramp from outside will lead you to the second floor. This second floor is chock-full of independent merchants and scavs looking to flip scrap or artifacts for food, water, and ammunition.

Ascending the stairs again, the third floor is the most secure portion of the building. Here there is a ramshackle infirmary where multiple Scavs lay injured, a plethora of more connected Seekers selling their highest quality wares, and a number of hired hands pulling security through the windows and embrasures around the top floor.

The roof is generally inaccessible, as the stairs inside the building have collapsed and no other method has been manufactured by the residents. 

A basement below the main building is accessible from the ground floor, where members of less-than-friendly factions come to trade with the residents and visitors of the Flea Market. In particular, the Mercenaries always station a representative here. 

#### The Forester's Hut
In the south-eastern most corner of [[#The Haven]], a two-story tower marks the end of the claimed area. The tower itself is made of the same light stone of the other ancient buildings of this place, and the inside is seemingly occupied.

A man who goes by the name "Forester" lives in and defends the tower against the few threats that make their way north-west from [[#The Factory]] or [[#The Sticks]].



## The Sticks
#### The Eastern Breach 
A breach in the massive wall around Minyostalma has been reinforced by raw sharp metals and clearly has been dug out to provide headroom as one travels through the breach and immediately into [[#The Trap Town]].

#### The Dark Bonfire (1d6 RADS)
West of [[#The Trenches]] and North of the [[#The Logging Camp]], a thin patch of pine woods surrounds a clearing. In this clearing, a circular portion of the ground dips into a stone divot. The stone circle in this clearing supports an anomalous fire, a dark purple core licking out into sharp grey tips of painful flame (necrotic & fire).

#### The Trenches
West of [[#The Trap Town]], a network of shallow and narrow ravines give this location it's name, and it is the site of a number of prolonged and brutal firefights between Scavs of the Sticks and the Haven, and mobile forces from the White Flame Military, the Trenches has sustained severe damage.

#### The Trap Town
A small village rests in a quiet still against the north-eastern portion of the military's wall. To an uneducated Scav, this place would seem to be an unoccupied and unclaimed bounty of scrap to be had - but they are distinctly wrong. 

Under the surface of this town, in the basements and bunkers, a relatively safe "city" flourishes. The majority of the occupants of the city are independent Scavs or members of the Extramis Chapter, and can navigate through and out of the kill-field on the surface.

While on the surface, a creature entering or exiting the Town or a specific building in Town must make a DC 19 Perception Check to detect any of the traps in Town;
	- Hanging Beam; 18 DEX Save, 4d10+15 bludg.
	- Foot Noose; 21 Sleight of Hand to escape, 1d6 bludg. on 10ft fall.
	- Spikepit; 19 DEX Save, 2d10+5 piercing & 18 CON Save 4d6+20 poison or half.

#### The Logging Camp
East of the [[#The Rookie Checkpoint]], the Logging Camp is the main entrance to [[#The Sticks]] from the West.

The Camp is surrounded stumps, clearly cut during the ancient times of Minyostalma using their interesting machinery. 

A large storehouse keeps bundles of logs and a large metal cart used for logging. Another of these carts is seemingly crashed or stuck in the ground.

#### The Spike Fields
East of [[#The Logging Camp]], a large open field separates the major locations of [[#The Sticks]], and gives the area it's name. This open field is littered with natural spike pits that have been hidden by the residents of [[#The Trap Town]] or revealed by unlucky travelers.
	- Spikepit; 19 DEX Save, 2d10+5 piercing & 18 CON Save 4d6+20 poison or half.

#### The Dangerous Ruins (1d6 RADS)
South of [[#The Trap Town]] and East of [[#The Spike Fields]], a construction site has clearly been ravaged by looters and firefights that have occurred there. Its rubble provides good cover, and much of the scaffolding surrounding the half-built structure remains accessible, leading to high-ground shooting positions upon the roof of the building.

#### The Pond (1d6 RADS)
South of [[#The Logging Camp]], a large pond stands still, surrounded by thick forest. The water of the Pond is nearly crystal clear, leaving the surface-floor visible. There are a number of bones, both humanoid and otherwise, loose rocks, and some minor vegetation.

#### The Forest Gate
Directly South of [[#The Spike Fields]], a large gated stone fence separates [[#The Sticks]] from the greater [[#Grey Forest]]. Nearby the gate, a small building acts as the gate-house, and it has since been refitted as a semi-permanent residence for passing groups.

#### The Outlook
East of [[#The Forest Gate]] and South of [[#The Dangerous Ruins (1d6 RADS)]], the Outlook is a tall stone tower unfinished in construction, but nonetheless provides a powerful spotting area for all of [[#The Sticks]]. Scaling the scaffolding would be easier than navigating the inside of the tower.



## The Factory
#### The Showroom
As the major entrance from [[#Broken Swamps]], the Showroom is a major killing-field for those who currently occupy the high-ground in the Factory.

The Showroom itself is wrapped in scaffolds, where one can navigate through the upper levels of the Factory, and in the central space, a large dais hosts a pile of rubble and trash. Heading through the halls and rooms, one arrives in [[#The Loading Bay]].

The Showroom is a Ground Level with access to the Basement at [[#The Arcane Chambers (3d6 RADS)]] and the Upper at [[#The Office]].

#### The Arcane Chambers (3d6 RADS)
West of [[#The Cellars]], the Arcane Chambers are a series of large rooms in which various arcane inscriptions, human waste, and evidence of occupation. This is the major barracks within the Factory for those without Radiation Detection.

The Arcane Chambers is a Basement Level with access to the Ground at [[#The Showroom]].

#### The Cellars
East of the [[#The Arcane Chambers (3d6 RADS)]], the Cellars acted as a storage area for the Factory above, but having fallen into a rough cacophony of debris and corridors, the Cellars are now a dangerous hotspot for firefights.

At the end of the Cellars, a large vault-style door is locked under anomalous key. Behind this door lies a safe passage to [[#The Mess Hall (1d6 RADS)]]'s cellar storage area.

The Cellars is a Basement Level with access to the Ground at [[#The Storage Tanks]].

#### The Rafters
Connecting the Upper Levels of the Factory, the Rafters are the primary holding position of the occupants of the Factory due to its high-ground advantage.

The Rafters is a Upper Level with access to the Ground at [[#The Storage Tanks]], [[#The Loading Bay]], [[#The Pallets]], and [[#The Stamping Line]].

#### The Storage Tanks
East of [[#The Showroom]], the Storage Tanks once were used to hold some liquid for the processes of this Factory, but now it acts as a middle-ground between the other Ground level areas.

The three large round tanks are the defining feature in this area, reaching from the Basement to the Upper Levels, a good cover or a tremendous maneuvering challenge.

The Storage Tanks is a Ground Level, with access to the Basement at [[#The Cellars]] and the Upper at [[#The Rafters]].

#### The Office
East of [[#The Rafters]], the Office is a section of the Upper level that has been heavily reinforced and endowed with comforts, and as such acts as the most favorable base-of-operations within the Factory. No historical artifacts can be found here, as anything the ancients left behind has been gathered and lost, leaving the room to bend to its occupants will.

The Office is a Upper Level with access to the Ground at [[#The Showroom]].

#### The Loading Bay
As the primary egress from [[#The Base]] to [[#The Cordon]], much of the Loading Bay is heavily trapped, and provides a significant advantage to any defenders within the Factory. 

A series of halls and rooms for break lead north, towards [[#The Showroom]]. A large set of metal double doors lie dismantled upon the ground, leaving the frame open into [[#The Pallets]].

The Loading Bay is a Ground Level with access to the Upper at [[#The Rafters]].

#### The Pallets
South of [[#The Storage Tanks]], a series of metal pallets have been stacked atop each other in this large warehouse space. 

A large set of metal double doors exits [[#The Factory]], and a wide stone path leads into [[#The Construction Site (2d6 RADS)]] of [[#The City]]. 

Another set of double doors would section the Pallets and [[#The Loading Bay]], but instead lie dismantled upon the ground, leaving the frame open and accessible. 

Opposing this open doorframe, a third set of large metal doors stands strong, and leads into [[#The Stamping Line]].

The Pallets is a Ground Level with access to the Upper at [[#The Rafters]].

#### The Stamping Line
East of [[#The Pallets]], a series of machines and conveyers link and weave across the ground of this area. Much of the materials that make the insides of these machines have been thoroughly scavenged, and left to bear.

A large set of metal double doors separates the Stamping Line from [[#The Pallets]]. Another smaller set of doors leads through to a pair of rooms and then the [[#The Importing Pallets (1d6 RADS)]].

The Stamping Line is a Ground Level with access to the Upper at [[#The Rafters]].

## The Base
#### The Importing Pallets (1d6 RADS)
East of [[#The Front Gate (2d6 RADS)]], a large garage door stinks offensively of death and gunpowder. The Importing Pallets are functionally a kill-box for those coming from excursions through [[#The Factory]], as a large portion of the furniture and pallets within this space have been refit into a thin maze. 

#### The Front Gate (2d6 RADS)
The path leading south from the [[#Grey Forest]] leads directly to the Base's Front Gate, where a large lawn makes for a beautiful scene in the front of the brutalist military compound.

Entering the building and heading West, [[#The Importing Pallets]] await the unsuspecting Scav, and on the opposite side, doors lead into [[#The Mess Hall]].

#### The Mess Hall (1d6 RADS)
West of [[#The Front Gate (2d6 RADS)]], the Mess Hall is a bloody mess of a cafeteria, covered in dry blood, ruined food-stuff, and human waste.

A small kitchen is attached, but has been since looted and fairly obstructed, but those who can slip through would a storage room. On a wall of this cellar, a large vault-style door is locked under anomalous key. Behind this door lies a safe passage to [[#The Factory]]'s [[#The Cellars]].

#### The Broken Gate (1d6 RADS)
West of [[#The Intelligence Center (1d6 RADS)]], a grass alley has been covered in broken glass and snapped metals. The gate surrounding [[#The Base]] has been broken here, but provides little egress, as one must blaze a trail through [[#Grey Forest]] before finding their way - a dangerous task.

#### The Intelligence Center (1d6 RADS)
In the center of [[#The Base]], south of [[#The Front Gate (2d6 RADS)]] & north of [[#The Old Barracks (1d6 RADS)]], the Intelligence Center was once the headquarters of the Ancient Elven Military. A large circular room is scattered with dozens of broken machines, astrewn papers, and covered in blood and blaster marks.
