# The Places...
Each of the following locations describe the contents of the singular hex-mile they are contained within (excepting the City and Village, which are two and three hex-miles respectively, and are still described below). 

## The Cordon
This region of the Old is known as the Cordon. [[#White-Flame Militants]] hold the majority of this area, and uses this outpost to supply and command operations within the Old performed by these soldiers. 

#### The Western Entrance
The Western Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Western Entrance are exclusively to prevent unidentified persons from exiting the Old.

Entering this gate leads directly to the area within the Cordon known as the Reserve.

#### The Recreations Camp
The Recreation Camp is directly north of [[#The Reserve]]. The WFM in the area use the Recreations Camp to relieve the stress of operating within the Old.

Alongside physical recreation games, such as ringtoss or kickball, there are small cabins for warmth, table games, drug use, and sexual recreation.

#### The Killing Fields
The Killing Fields are directly north of [[#The Depot]]. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old. 

The name "Killing Fields" was given to this area of their perimeter due to the number of Scavs that attempt to breach the Cordon from the north.

#### The Mudhouse
Northeast of the Depot, a mudbrick outhousehouse stands out as a lone survivor amidst the desolation surrounding it. Surrounding the outhouse are the ruins of other abandoned structures, their walls crumbling, serving as eerie reminders of a home long lost.

#### The Reserve
A series of large tents and semi-permanent structures form a small military town. WFM use the Reserve and the surrounding areas as their primary base of operations within the Old.

Trails lead from the Reserve throughout the Cordon, connecting the dispirit settlements into one grander area.

#### The Depot
The largest and most-well protected area within the Cordon, the Depot is a warehouse used by the WFM as storage for their resources and equipment that is exclusively for WFM members only. It is located east of [[#The Reserve]], and west of [[#The Hunting Slots]].

#### The Hunting Slots
The Hunting Slots are directly east of [[#The Depot]]. The WFM have a secure perimeter around this area, and have used the area as a "killzone" against the natural dangers and other factions within the Old. 

The name "Hunting Slots" was given to this area of their perimeter due to the number of natural mutant threats that attempt to breach the Cordon from the east. Much of the food supply the WFM eat comes from these mutants.

#### The Barracks
The sparse activity within the Reserve continues south into the Barracks. This area stands in stark contrast to [[#The Recreations Camp]] for it's somber air. Made of bare walls surely reinforced by layers of metal and mortar, the Barracks are used exclusively for sleep and the storage of personal accoutrement. 

#### The Training Grounds
South of [[#The Depot]] and East of [[#The Barracks]], the Training Grounds is an area filled with obstacles, shooting ranges, and combat simulations to hone and test the skills of both new recruits and veterans.

#### The Forward Post
South-east of [[#The Depot]], a single rusting metal watch-tower serves as lookout for the surrounding tents and reinforced ruins. The soldiers stationed here know that they are the first line of defense against anything that Minyostalma will throw at them.



## The Haven
A welcoming Seeker holding that is in conflict with the nearby Militants at [[#The Cordon]] and the hostile Scavs and Mercenaries that operate in and nearby [[#The Factory]].

#### The Northern Entrance
The Northern Entrance is one of the three formally operated gates in the walls that contain the Old. The standing orders of those stationed at the Northern Entrance include both allowing entrants for a fee and disallowing, by fire and force, any unidentified persons from exiting.

Entering this gate leads into [[#The Damaged Chapel]], where a small trail leads to [[#The Rookie Village]] and eventually the Haven at large.

#### The Rookie Village
The so-called "Rookie Village" was - at one point - a small hunting settlement by the name of Belthaenne, but it is now occupied by a number of generally unaffiliated Seekers and is managed by a negligently profitable Goliath merchant who calls himself [[Ondo]].

A thin trail connects the Rookie Village to [[#The Damaged Chapel]] to the east and to [[#The Levee]] to the south. 

#### The Damaged Chapel
Standing west of [[#The Rookie Village]], Damaged Chapel is a small compound of a main Chapel, a small Barracks, and a series of mausoleums throughout a large yard of marked graves. 

The Chapel itself is quite badly damaged, as the supporting structures of the second story have failed and caused the roof of the building to partially collapse inward - thus the name. The battles that have taken place within the building surely do not help either. Under scrutiny of the surviving religious images, two things can be known;
	- The text is [[Sylvan (language)]], and the images depict a bountiful land of nature.
	- The god worshipped here is named [[Kor-ket]], and a repeating motif is "All this is made to be yours to do what you will."

The graveyard is largely uninteresting to those who care little for the names of dead souls, but the mausoleums that scatter throughout are more interesting - once used by the resting dead, they are now used as small shelters, storage areas, and military defenses (see Embrasure).

A thin trail travels from the front door of the chapel westward towards and into [[#The Rookie Village]].

#### The Lone Farmstead
North of [[#The Rookie Checkpoint]], the Lone Farmstead was once an important economic feature of the growing empire. Much of the land to the Farmstead's west is now abandoned and overgrown farmland. The Farmstead itself consists of a collection of three buildings, and two ancient objects.

On the Farmstead, a small house of three rooms has been long looted of useful material. Across a small clearing, a decrepit wooden barn creaks and groans, threatening to break down at any moment in the wind. Standing tall and strong between the two other buildings on the clearing, a large stone granary and mill acts as the most defensible building on the compound.

The ancient objects seem dangerous. A curious mind would likely identify the many wheels on frame as an ancient iteration of a simple cart, but the mystery lies in its purpose and power source. 

#### The Levee (1d6 RAD)
South of [[#The Rookie Village]], a large field of dead plants and puddles separates the people in the North from the dangers of [[#The Toxic Swamps]]. No Minyostalman structures are present here, and rather the area is named for the ditch of rubble constructed and maintained by the Rookies.

#### The Crossroads
West of [[#The Rookie Checkpoint]], a large plate of white rock forms a plus symbol on the face of the earth. At the center of this large rock crossroad, on the south-eastern side, a thin pole of this white rock emerges from the ground. Clearly broken, this pole is a sharp hazard - so much so that a corpse of a Scav is lying impaled around the pole.

#### The Rookie Checkpoint
East of [[#The Crossroads]], a large fence has been erected between [[#The Haven]] and [[#The Sticks]]. It is most commonly occupied by a number of Scavs working for [[Ondo]], defending the Haven at large from the Bandits in [[#The Sticks]].

#### The Toxic Swamps (2d6 RAD)
The land south of [[#The Levee]] is the most dangerous space within [[#The Haven]]. Deep puddles of toxic irradiated water cover most of the surface within this area, were one wrong step can lead to entrapment and a slow painful death.

Continuing south or west will lead into the [[#Broken Swamps]] and then [[#The Cordon]] beyond it.

#### The Flea Market
South of [[#The Crossroads]] and east of [[#The Levee]] stands a large crumbled building known as the "Flea Market". 

What was once the ground floor has crumbled to its supports. Those few rooms that are not impassable are derelict, and devoid of occupants.

Taking the stairs from within the building or the makeshift ramp from outside will lead you to the second floor. This second floor is chock-full of independent merchants and scavs looking to flip scrap or artifacts for food, water, and ammunition.

Ascending the stairs again, the third floor is the most secure portion of the building. Here there is a ramshackle infirmary where multiple Scavs lay injured, a plethora of more connected Seekers selling their highest quality wares, and a number of hired hands pulling security through the windows and embrasures around the top floor.

The roof is generally inaccessible, as the stairs inside the building have collapsed and no other method has been manufactured by the residents. 

A basement below the main building is accessible from the ground floor, where members of less-than-friendly factions come to trade with the residents and visitors of the Flea Market. In particular, the Mercenaries always station a representative here. 

#### The Forester's Hut
In the south-eastern most corner of [[#The Haven]], a two-story tower marks the end of the claimed area. The tower itself is made of the same light stone of the other ancient buildings of this place, and the inside is seemingly occupied.

A man who goes by the name "Forester" lives in and defends the tower against the few threats that make their way north-west from [[#The Factory]] or [[#The Sticks]].

## The Sticks
A safezone in the middle of a well crafted maze of traps and hazards. 

#### The Eastern Breach 

#### The Dark Bondfire

#### The Trenches

#### The Trap Town

#### The Logging Camp
East of the [[#The Rookie Checkpoint]], the Logging Camp is the main entrance to [[#The Sticks]] from the West.

The Camp is surrounded stumps, clearly cut during the ancient times of Minyostalma using their interesting machinery. 

A large storehouse keeps bundles of logs and a large metal cart used for logging. Another of these carts is seemingly crashed or stuck in the ground.
