## History
Once, the western half of the [[Great Northern Forests]], immolated by the [[Great Fires]], and born anew under [[Its Greatness]]'s influence.
## Governance
The people that live in this area only survive long following [[The Church of the White Flame]]. The Church rules from the [[Holy City of Kanielkiln]], the final site of [[Its Greatness]]' recession.

## Culture
#### Heritage
Many of the first Winter Elves made their homes here before the [[Great Fires]] cast them from Alaturmen. Now, all that stands of the time before [[Its Greatness]] is [[The Old]].

Since then, people of all kinds have flocked back into the Holyl'nds to worship [[Its Greatness]], but [[The Church of the White Flame]] has a clear preference for pure human or elf in regards to social status and upwards mobility.

#### Language
The people in this area speak a common language known as [[High Common]]. It claims roots from ancient elven and human languages.

#### Belief
The people of the Holyl'nd revere [[Its Greatness]] for allowing itself to be contained and giving their peers power.
