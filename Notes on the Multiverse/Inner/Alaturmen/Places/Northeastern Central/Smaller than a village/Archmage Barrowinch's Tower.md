# Archamge Barrowinch's Tower
## Barrowinch's Goals
1. Above all else, I wish to protect the secrets hidden here. My research is worth so much more than my life.
2. My equipment, including my help, is expensive, and I would prefer to preserve it whenever possible.
3. I wish to unlock the secrets of memory.
