# Description
This is the hometown and first holding of King [[Arthur Simonson]], who personally liberated the once village from the tyrannical rule of [[Edward Bodaim]]. After returning from his grand adventures, [[Arthur Simonson]] used his massive wealth to fund the construction of the Castle from which the holding gathers it's name. During the [[Unification]], the larger wall was built to protect and ease housing for those fleeing to Castle Prosper.

## Physicality of the Holding
A large stone walled city populated by wood-slat homes and thatch roofed brick buildings surrounds a grand keep, the noble Keep Prosper of his lordship [[Arthur Simonson]]. The dark brick roads are well kept by the city's denizens, and payed guard patrol the streets. A toll is collected at the wall's gate; if the toll cannot be paid, the laws of the city state that the entrant may be permitted a one night stay in the many guest chambers of the Castle after which time they are to be removed from the city and travel by any caravans leaving the holding.

## Population Distribution
The population of Castle Prosper is a great example of the population of the nation at large. The [[Nobles of Prosper]] have homes here, and the city is split into three pseudo-districts of dense poor housing, middle class merchant homes and shoppe, and a ridge of noble housing. Those that live in or closest to the Keep Proper live in the most wealth.

## Defenses
The [[Nobles of Prosper]] pay for good protection, both for and from the common folk. The city guard is well trained and patrols at all hours. The walls of the Keep and the City make for a great defensive position.
