# Central Alaturmen
#### A sub-region of [[Alaturmen]]
## Boundaries
This area is bound by the first [[Wildlands]] border, and I cannot find a way to describe it better than the thirty-six thousand square miles surrounding the east end of the [[Deakred Range]].

## Contents
Because this area is so large, it is broken into it's four larger corners - [[Northwestern Central]], [[Northeastern Central]], [[Southwestern Central]], and [[Southeast Central]] - as well as some [[World Features]], such as [[Deakred Range]] and the [[Alvalini River]].
