# Renshaw
#### The Merchant's Short-Cut
## Holding of [[Hillkeep Loyalists]]
### Located in [[Northern Third]], W25
## Description

A bustling town; not quite a city, but certainly not a village. The population of Renshaw, some 1300 people, is predominantly Human - not to say there is no diversity, of course, but this is an important factor in its history - and legacy.

Currently, the Eques of Renshaw, [[Patrica Borig]], is having major issues slowing and stopping the rise of the [[Cult of Reborn Glory]], a xenophobic pro-humanocentric group of politicians and warriors who are currently being led towards the clutches of [[Demons]].
