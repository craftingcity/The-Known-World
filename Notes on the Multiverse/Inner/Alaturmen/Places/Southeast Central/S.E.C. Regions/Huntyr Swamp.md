### Scenarios
- AA29. Miniature War-game
	- A large board of marble and steel - alternating, forming a board 8 square spaces square - is raised above the moss & supported by multiple columns of stone and metal. Atop the board, there are miniature figurines made of the same marble and steel. They are sorted into teams by their material, each set to mirror the other.
	- These figures are large, but not heavy. They are built to be moved.
	- On each side/team and of each material, there are eight warriors, two square carts, two knighted horses, two armored war-cleric, a woman in nobly guady plate-mail wielding a greatsword, and a cowering man wearing a massive crown, far too large for his head.
	- It's chess.
