The Great Southern Mossland is a massive field of plump wet moss that grows in [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]]. It is split into three baronies, each held by a separate baron; [[Eastlick Mossland]], [[Westlick Mossland]], and [[Centerlick Mossland]], as well as potions of the Southern Mossland being controlled by Barons who have lost portions of their claimed territories - ie the above.

Please see the above for more information.
