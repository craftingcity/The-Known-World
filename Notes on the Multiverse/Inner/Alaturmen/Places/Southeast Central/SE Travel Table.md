# South Eastern Central Alaturmen
Much of the South East is civilized. People here are from all over, and they all pay respect to their Barons. There is nearly constant war in this area, between barons, groups of barons, etc., but these people are trained to protect all citizens of the Combine of Democratic Peoples.
