## Holding of [[Beasts Righteous]]
### Located in [[Reugb Marshes]], X:Y
## Description
### Quote

Boneborn is a large city in the [[Reugb Marshes]]. The majority of the population is humanoid (generally locals have deep Kenku and Tabaxi heritage), but the laws of the city require support for non-humanoids as well.

Typically, the buildings are supported by the natural elements of the marshes, but many buildings use constructed stabilizers as well.

### General Public Disposition

Most outsiders are welcome, as this is the largest city in the marshes, but the [[Beasts Righteous]] are quite protective of their businesses. Majorly, we're producing Food and Wood, but there is a large production of poor bog-iron.
