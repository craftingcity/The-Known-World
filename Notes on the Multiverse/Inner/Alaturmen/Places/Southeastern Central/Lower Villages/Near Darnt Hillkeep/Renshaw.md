# Renshaw
#### The Merchant's Short-Cut
## Holding of [[Hillkeep Loyalists]]
### Located in [[Northern Third]], W25
## Description

A bustling town; not quite a city, but certainly not a village. The population of Renshaw, some 1300 people, is predominantly Human - not to say there is no diversity, of course, but this is an important factor in its history - and legacy.

In 105AF, the Eques of Renshaw [[Patrica Borig]] had major issues slowing and stopping the rise of the [[Cult of Reborn Glory]], a xenophobic pro-humanocentric group of politicians and warriors. With the assistance of "the Hatdroppers" (see [[Sarahouse Game]]), she was able to remove the support for these xenophobic politicians.
