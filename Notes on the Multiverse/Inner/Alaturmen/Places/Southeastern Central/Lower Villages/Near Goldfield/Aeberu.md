## Holding of [[Dampguard]]
### Located in [[Gabrin Shrublands]], X:Y
## Description
### "Why earn when you could take from someone who does?"

Aeberu is a city of ill repute. The [[Dampguard]] control the city, and defend their interests here.

### General Public Disposition

[[Dampguard]] / +
[[Hillkeep Loyalists]] / -

### Background
Aeberu was one of the first settlements the ancient Triton created after traversing the barriers to the [[Alvalini River]] and [[Alaturmen]] at large. Since then, the [[Dampguard]] and [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]] have been formed and well established. 

Aeberu first and foremost acts as a stop on the roads inland and north from the Alvalini for merchants and travelers. Secondarily, the [[Dampguard]] use it as a Base of Influence, repacking the goods taken from the River before transporting them further inland. 

Recently (10XAF), a subfaction of [[Hillkeep Loyalists]] has been sniffing about the [[Dampguard]]'s business.
