# Great Quillbuck Jungle
#### A sub-region of [[Southeastern Central]]
## Boundaries
## Contents
The Great Quillbuck Jungle is a massive jungle that cleaves into the [[Great Southern Mossland]] of [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]]. Due to it's great size, this region is further split into two smaller regions, that of the [[Northern Quillbuck Jungle]] and the [[Southern Quillbuck Jungle]]. These two regions are neigh indistinguishable to the untrained eye, but the boundary between these two regions is marked by the soil becoming more solid or loose, which happens to form a fine natural border between the northern and southern portions of the Quillbuck Jungle.
