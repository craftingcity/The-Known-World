# Title
#### A sub-region of [[Great Southern Mossland]]
## Boundaries
## Contents
### Flora
### Scenarios
- AM30. The Old Arch (visible, on road)
	- Over the [[Three Nation Highways]] coming into [[Beacon]], about four and half miles before the walls of the city, a large arch made of plain gray stone is decorated in what was once fine filigree, but is now a scratched, defaced, and nearly ruined surface that only alludes to its ancient beauty.
	- Those who claim to know the origin of the Old Arch are rarely correct, as the few who know it's truth are duty bound to keep its powerful secrets.
		- The Old Arch is under constant guard of 8 members of [[Cenva Minyo]], who would not reveal themselves unless they felt it absolutely necessary.
		- The scholars of [[Cenva Minyo]] know that this was one of the four points of origin for Elves on Alaturmen, and could in theory be used as the structure to a very powerful *gate* to another Plane.
