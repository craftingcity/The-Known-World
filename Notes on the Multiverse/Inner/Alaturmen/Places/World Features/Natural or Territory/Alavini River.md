The Alavini River seperates the land of [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]] and [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]]. It is often the way of many boats crossing up and down the river doing trade and transport. It meets the [[Deakred Range]] at [[Coalition City]], the mountains' most eastern end.

The Alavini is highly contested territory between the many barons on its eastern bank and the thieves, nomads, and Tetramocians on its western bank.
