Let me tell you a story...

# In the Beginning
In the Time before Time, for a moment and forever, the goblins thrived in the soup of Primordial nothing. Right after that, one single moment later, [[Tetrimoc]] split the heavens of Alaturmen and threw himself down unto it. There he was given his first wound by the lone mountain known now as Kailkeep. 

From the blood sprayed across this mountain rose the Kobolds of Kailkeep. Long did they wait for their Master to claim them, but he slept for too long, his injury too large. The Kobolds claimed themselves, disavowed their creator god and swore to work only for themselves. Without the direction of Tetrimoc, they became wicked and cruel.

Kailkeep is a massive complex dug by a fanatical group of Kobold for two main purposes; first, the safety of themselves, and second, the torment of others. These kobolds are craft.

They rule this massive complex, and even stronger monsters respect them as the true keepers of Kailkeep – except one, with whom the collective of kobold work as equal: Terra, the Idol of Earth. Why Terra began to work with them, I would dare not ask, but she has become as horrible as they are.

## Hooks
### Druids of Terra
For some time, the Druids of Terra were hidden, guarding the secrets of Arcane magic. Recently, the druid's connection to Terra has been severed – for reasons they would not share, even if they knew – and many of their texts have been stolen. Perhaps the adventurers were exploring and stumbled upon the hidden druids, or were sought out for their prowess. In either case, if the Druids can trust them, they would ask for their assistance in these affairs. And even if they can't be trusted, maybe they would anyways, but be prepared to ambush these assholes right after they find the goods.

### Missing People
For as long as there has been a mountain, there have been people bored enough to want to climb it. When those people travel to Kailkeep, either for fun or profit, they do not return. The explorer's husband is distraught, as is the Cartagrophers' Guild, and so too are the dwarfs, who are failing to set up a remote operation without their Quartermaster, Explosives Expert, and Cook.

### God-damn Raiders!
The inhabitants of Kailkeep are sustained by hunting as well as gathering. When people are not coming to them, they must come to people. If the Kobolds have been having a rough year, they'll either send raids themselves or order one of the factions under their command to raid for them.

### Arcane Hotspot
In my world, Alaturmen, magic is not common. The amount of magical items alone would ping someone's radar, let alone the powerful primordial force of Terra forsaking her druids and moving into a mountain. Anyone attuned to the Weave feels the heat of density in the area of Kailkeep, even from afar.

If your setting is of a higher commonality of magic, this hook becomes much simpler; go get the loot.

## Outline
### Philosophy
Kailkeep is a sad place where evil festers. Those who have come before leave as much light as they can, but it is quickly dimmed by the cruelty on display in this place. From a design perspective, I wish to present a series of problems that ask for a quick or precise solution, lest the consequences come to pass. Often times, as in other games, the consequence for failure in Kailkeep is fatal, but please tailor your game's content to your table. Talk with them about they story they want to tell, and if it isn't one of bleak survival but rather rampant obliteration of evil, this is not a module designed to provide the ladder experience.

This is built for player's to survive and run from, not beat into nothingness. Put a little fear back in the hearts and minds of your friends, family, or otherwise.

I chose Kobolds as my muse because of the Tale of Tucker's Kobolds. Its funny, but I wished for a more Griffon McElroy's Wonderland than the basic power-dungeon designing kobolds.

### The Kobold's Goals
1. First and foremost, the Kobolds of Kailkeep want to protect themselves. Their collective survival is the most important thing to them both as a collective and individually; a Kobold values their clutchmate's security over their own life if they fucked up and got caught out.
2. Secondarily, the Kobolds want to gain more power than they have now. Again, this is true of the individual and the collective, some Kobolds run the Hells for a chance for a change of fate, and all Kobolds want Kobolds to rule Alaturmen, just like everyone else does, right?
3. Tertiarily, the Kobolds want to appease their partner, Terra, and their followers. The easiest way to do that is to entertain them while they are well-fed and harbored.

### Kailkeep's Secrets
#### Proving Grounds
While the Hells of Kailkeep are used as a method of collecting resources, punishing wrongdoers, and entertaining the masses, it also acts as a system of recruitment; "Hey, if you're good enough to do that once, we'll kit you out and pay you to keep doing this". Sometimes the winners say yes. Other times, they do not truly win.

#### Vast Arcane Power
For whatever reason, the Kobolds of Kailkeep have access to Terran's great powers and have used them to create structures of stone nearly at will. Terran also has enchanted the mountain, preventing unwanted manipulation of the mountain stone.

#### Curse Factory
Of the many arcane secrets the Kobolds of Kailkeep have mastered, the art of creating cheap enchanted weaponry is one of them. The only cost is a curse! Some curses can be worked around, others cannot. Those that can are typically worn and reproduced for those that would this particular enchantment would benefit. Those that cannot are given as false boons to those inside the Hells, adding some Hope to their lives, and some spice to the Kobold's Entertainment.

#### Corrupted Dragon
Long ago, when the Kobolds were first crafting Kailkeep's Hells, the dragons Kakurak and Luzikiemal visited. There, Kakurak met his greatest ally. And there, Luzikiemal perished. 

Since that time, the Kobolds of Kailkeep have reanimated and corrupted the corpse of Luzikiemal as a set piece in their entertainment.


### The Factions of Kailkeep
#### Kobolds
The Kobolds of Kailkeep have gone half-mad with the perceived betrayal of their Blood-Master [[Tetrimoc]]. They are the rulers of Kailkeep, and the other inhabitants know it. They formed and maintain the Hells for their entertainment and to collect power in the form of equipment or recruits.

Groups of Kobold who commit a grievous crime are sentenced to Kailkeep's Hells. Some Kobold who feel they have no other prospects volunteer as to enter the Hells as a Champion of Kailkeep.

The many kobold "civilians" who work and keep Kailkeep, both Hells and Proper, enjoy spending time with their clutchmates and watching the higher levels of the Hells on their free time. Some lucky kobold make good bets on particular newcomers and make spectacular winnings.

#### Inhabitants of Kailkeep
There are two large categories of creatures that Inhabit Kailkeep, those with and those without "true" intelligence, ie language, planning, that stuff.

##### Intelligent Factions
###### Kobolds of Kailkeep
###### Goblin Loyalists
###### Goblin Dissenters
###### Red Gnoll
###### Gaund Loyalists
###### Ancients of Mountainhall
###### Golden Claw Guard
###### Honorable Thieves
###### Survivalists
###### Reformed Entertainers
##### Beasties
###### Ankheg, Kruthik, Wurm, Carrion Crawler
###### Ooze
###### Unusual Rodents
###### Genoid
###### Mad-walkers
###### Yeeqzu'g, Mad-speaker
###### Bernet, Lodestone Golem
###### Luzikiemal, Risen

### Kailkeep's Features
#### Terra's Mountain
The Idol of Earth (or another powerful-earth-manipulating entity who would fit) Terra has claimed this mountain as her lair. Whether that is a choice she made is up to you as the game-master. On Alaturmen, Terra abandoned her Druids after learning that her sibling, Anima, had betrayed Terra's secrets to their Druids without her permission or knowledge. In a fit of rage, she sundered her Druids' grove and took much of her own teachings with her as she fled to the greatest place of refuge known on Alaturmen; Kailkeep.

#### False Allure Architecture
In its lowest floors, the first three, it is a carefully crafted dungeon of false allure – stone cobble halls weaving a tale of mystery and woe, promises of dark treasures left behind in a great abandonment. The antagonist in this story is a Kobold Wizard who binds an elemental to do his bidding and destroy the people who were here before. As the story carved into the reliefs, columns, and in the arts remaining unfolds, it becomes more and more clear that this Antagonist is really our Protagonist, and the story of the lower levels twists into our Heroe's favor before...

#### Hells Architecture
The fourth level presents a drastic change of theme. Where once there was red cobble and dusty crypt, there is flat black marble and translucently thin stone stronger than steel surrounded by blasts of color and symbol. Beyond the first three levels, the dungeons of Kailkeep serve as a mix of entertainment, punishment, and training for the inhabitants of Kailkeep.

Those who enter Kailkeep's Hells *cannot* return from whence they came. The only exit is forward. Up.

##### Ceilings
The ceilings of Kailkeep's Hells are crafted to fit large creatures, the distance from ceiling to floor is typically eighteen feet.

##### Veiwings and Tunnels
In some places of Kailkeep, there are windows of an incredibly thin, strong, and translucent stone. Behind them, Kobolds gather to view and bet on their favorite teams inside Kailkeep's Hells.

Between the areas of viewing, there are tunnels sized for two small creatures to walk side by side, about five by four and a half feet and spiraling staircases of similar sizing between levels.

##### Doors, Secret Doors, and Ko-Bolted Doors.
Beyond the "false allure" of Kailkeep's Lower Hells, Normal Doors (including double doors) are made of two inch thick black marble, and are handled in one-half inch thick white marble rings. These doors have no hinges, swinging around an internal cylinder of stone that holds the door in place in the wall.

The secret doors of Kailkeep are not uniform, but they are hidden similarly. Any and all secret doors marked on the maps are humbly suggested to require a DC 20 investigation check to notice, although surely some are easier or harder to spot then others. Please use your discretion.

Some doors in Kailkeep are "ko-bolted", meaning they cannot (as enforced by Terra's magic) be opened by any other than a living Kobold who has been Marked with the correct Access Bindings.

> ###### What the fuck is an Access Binding??
> It's like a keycard in a video game, except its a magic tattoo. Only certain Kobolds get access to the tunnel doors on certain levels, because you don't need the dude who maintains the slime pits in the pristine puzzle rooms, what if he goops the place up?
> No-one with an Access Binding is allowed to Entertain in the Hells, for the hopefully obvious reason of the massive advantage they would have against their foes, but they do maintenance work whenever an area is clear of Entertainers, and Operators go so far as to temporarily enclose areas in stone to work in peace.

##### Illumination
The Kobolds who view the Hells as entertainment have no need for light, except in the larger rooms of the Hells, in which case the # bio-luminescent mushroom Glowbulb has been cultivated. In most cases, the light the entertainers provide for themselves is sufficient.

##### Formatted Markings
Markings that are not magically hidden from Terra and the Operators are formatted in Terra's script with the date as yyy-mm-dd and a two centimetre wide, one centimetre deep border. Whenever any member of the [[Grand Pantheon]] or the concept of a higher power is mentioned, Terra's name is made its replacement upon formatting.

##### Scoreboard
Around Kailkeep there are "scoreboard" rooms. These places are often small, and dense with messages. The main feature of this room, however, is the indented wall and extended 2' slab below it. The slab is enchanted to display an image of the viewer's hand in its center. The intend, too is enchanted, and when one's hand is pressed to the slab below, a bank of information is accessed and returned to the illusion, publicly displaying the betting odds and entertainment rating of the owner of the hand, given they are still alive.

# Greater Map
Kailkeep has been crafted from the stone of the mountain by Kobolds for hundreds of years. It is so large and complex a structure that not all of it could be displayed here. Perhaps no matter where the players ascend from, they enter the next level presented here, some intervention by the fates, perhaps. That is not for me to decide, but you must know that the levels presented here only explore the tip of this massive structure.

The first three levels present very little challenge to even the greenest adventurers. Veterans should be presented with the feeling of unease, a prey standing too still – a hunter being hunted.

Above the third Level, Kailkeep presents a challenge constructed for three to five level five adventurers working together as a team with limited information about the truest natures of Kailkeep. A map of Kailkeep's Hells would be *wish*ful thinking to acquire outside of the Hells themselves, and even then, the procurement of such a valuable piece of information would be quite the feat – let alone the questions of Kailkeep's ability to even be mapped.

## Entering Kailkeep
Kailkeep is a massive structure, too big to map here. If one were to avoid the obvious, if you enter the mountain, you would eventually find yourself in the structure of Kailkeep.

### Exploring this Level
There are three variations of this "floor", though room is a better descriptor. 

#### 1. Pressure
Four bowls rest on four pressure plates on their four platforms in the four corners of the room. A fine dust sits on the sandstone fixtures of this room.

**Markings.**
**Dust.**
**Bowls.**
**Plates.**
**Platforms.**
**Hidden Trap Door.**
**Ko-bolted Door.**

##### Markings
On the floor of this room there are many (at least 7) square intentions with the [[Draconic]] runes extended that represent our understanding of "NO CHEAT". 

On the wall above the platform of the Kobold giving blood is a formatted marking in [[King's Common]];
> 026 - 07 - 14
> 
> They do not let us speak so plain;
> To let us share the gain
> So I share with you this ballad;
> Know I used these bowls for Salad
> 
> Good luck, and may the
> **TERRA** be with all of us
> 
> Ellis Hawkins, Daughter of Delilah

On the wall to the right of the Kobold giving food is a formatted marking in [[Infernal]];
> 014 - 02 - 02
> 
> Do not eat the hand that feeds you.
> 
> Know this. **TERRA** lives.

On the floor in a corner of the room that is bare of other marks is an unformatted marking in [[Celestial]];

> THIRY EXACTLY
> NO GREED
> NO TEMPRANCE

##### Dust
That used to be a person!

##### Bowls
These bowls are made of the same sandstone as the platforms, plates, and walls of this room. At the bottom of the bowl, the [[Draconic]] rune for our understanding of ~"thirty weight".

##### Plates
The plates are set to detect thirty pounds of pressure applied directly downwards. Once all four plates are triggered at the same time, the hidden trapdoor to level five opens. If any of the pressure is altered in any way, including adding more weight, the secondary trigger occurs, shutting the trap door and activating the gas trap of the **Hidden Holes**.

##### Platform
Each of the platforms depicts a Kobold giving something into a bowl. One shows a kobold willingly giving coins, another willingly giving food, another willingly giving their own blood, and another willingly giving books and scrolls.

At the bottom of each of the platforms are drilled grates that quickly reveal only darkness.

###### Hidden Holes
Along the platforms, there are small drilled holes that lead down into a tube before turning and continuing elsewhere. These have no marking or indications of any kind other than their existence.

These holes will dispense a horrible gas into the enclosed room upon the secondary trigger of the **Plates**. This gas does 1d4 poison damage and 1d4 necrotic damage. It is not flammable. It is very slightly more dense than air.

> ##### Trapping Efficiently
> I pretty consistently throughout my D&D experience have thought about how traps get set, and reset. Let's think about a simple spike pit. 
> I set it up by tying a rope to myself and an anchor, digging a hole, setting spikes at the bottom, and climbing out of the hole using my rope, and hiding the pit.
> How would I reset this? Eventually my pit will be too full of corpse to spike any casualties, how can I get the spikes clear, let alone collect any loot on these corpses. Am I, *personally*, resetting the camouflage every time someone falls through it? No way right? Not unless it's the only option. I'm gonna try to make a door or something at the bottom, or actuate a piston below the spikes to raise them.
> So when designing this gas trap, I was thinking about how it would be easiest to reset – if the gas is just slightly heavier than air, it would collect at the floor eventually. If this could automatically drain into the reserves, even better. Now I only need a bunch of tubing, a source of force for my gas, and a trigger, and I'll have a large portion of my trap reset for me.

##### Hidden Trap Door
In the center of the ceiling of this room is a thin line of space between the two blocks of sandstone that form the trapdoor the mechanisms of this room engage and disengage.

##### Ko-bolted Access Door
A door in the wall made of adamentine is marked with the [[Draconic]] rune that indicates our concept of "three" in the lower center of the door, and a small kobold-palm-shaped indentation marked with the same symbol on the palm, but smaller, above the rune.

#### 2. Spikes and Oil
##### Markings

##### The Spikes
Around the room in three foot intervals are rotating stone pillars with stilleto-esq blades that reach their point 5 inches out from their pillar. When some runs into these pillars, they become pierced by them; damaging them for 4d4 damage and restraining them.

##### The Oil
The Floor of this room is covered in a slick clear oil. Moving across this oil carefully requires a DC 17 check, probably a simple or proficient dexterity check or a relevant skill if you're feeling extra nice.

##### Hidden Trap Door
In the center of the ceiling of this room is a thin line of space between the two blocks of sandstone that form the trapdoor the mechanisms of this room engage and disengage.

##### Ko-bolted Access Door
A door in the wall made of adamentine is marked with the [[Draconic]] rune that indicates our concept of "three" in the lower center of the door, and a small kobold-palm-shaped indentation marked with the same symbol on the palm, but smaller, above the rune.

#### 3. Sand Table
This is a timed puzzle room. On the walls there are etchings of the Mountain Kailkeep is in, and a table with a lowered center (8") that contains to its brim and overflown onto the floor - as if swiped off - a fine red sand.

##### The Sand
A 'lil bit of something for 'yah, the table holds exactly 33 pounds of dry red sand, but when the kobolds reset the room, they use units of 35, and sweep the rest onto the floor. This means that there are two "un/intentional" extra pounds of dry sand. That very quickly become wet. And or flown down to the blocked sewer **Below the Table**.

##### The Vision Columns
As the stairs close behind the poor souls given this task, the vision columns fire up, and its runes hum and generate a fine dust that swirls together to form an image of a room of Kobold. These kobold begin to, out loud, in [[Draconic]], note defining features of each of the observed. After the Kobolds finish, the dust disappears and the vision fades. The **Mouths** begin to pour.

##### The Sand Table
Under the four legs of the table that holds the sand are pressure plates that are wired to detect an exact pressure-weight-degree. A cone of this dry red sand that is six inches taller than the outer edge of the table and or fourteen inches taller than the floor of the table's recess with a radius of 1.5' triggers these plates. in the center of the 8' by 5' rectangular table. This table contains a 7' by 4' by 8" recess build to contain the 33 pounds of sand found set in the table. 

This cone, when composed of entirely the dry red sand weighs 33 pounds exactly. Wet sand weighs twice as much as dry sand, meaning a cone of entirely wet sand need only be half as large – but still the same dimension. When using both wet and dry sand, use your discretion, let the dice tell the story, or do a bunch of boring math in the middle of the session. One of those three is bad advice. No~! You have to guess!

##### Below the Table
Below the table is a three-foot diameter spindled adamentine grate drains into a cylinder in the floor. After two feet, this cylinder thins to two inches. A stone trap-wall closes at the same time as the stairs here, trapping the sewage from the Mouths in with those who triggered the stairs. Austensibly, a mage comes and spews water everywhere, then someone comes and resets the sand, and then the room is ready to go again.

##### The Mouths of Refuse
In each of the four ceiling-corners of the room, there are four stone statues of winged kobold sticking there, their mouths agape. After the Vision Columns are finished, the **Mouths** begin to stream a brown water into the room. This is Kailkeep's sewage. 

##### Art of Kailkeep
The Art of Kailkeep has the exact dimensions that are required for the plates below the table to trigger. 

Anyone who has a good eye for art or difference in works (or both, like a forger) would notice the softer texture of the mountain art compared to the walls of the room. 

The Kobolds had one specific idea for what this symbolizes, build this, exactly, with this soft sand from our home. Or die, in our shit.

##### Markings
There are no markings in this room. Any attempts at marking in this room are futile, if they can be refuted by an Operator, they are instantly. If they could only be removed by a power as great as Terra, then a moment passes before it is removed.

##### Hidden Trap Door
In the center of the ceiling of this room is a thin line of space between the two blocks of sandstone that form the trapdoor the mechanisms of this room engage and disengage.

##### Ko-bolted Access Door
A door in the opposite wall as the Art of Kailkeep made of adamentine is marked with the [[Draconic]] rune that indicates our concept of three in the lower center of the door, and a small kobold-palm-shaped indentation marked with the same symbol on the palm, but smaller, above the rune.
