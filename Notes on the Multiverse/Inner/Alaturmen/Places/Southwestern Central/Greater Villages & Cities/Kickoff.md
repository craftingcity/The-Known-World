# Description
Kickoff's main industry is mining and exporting Durandurm crystal, a powerful magical component; beautiful clear crystal that is most commonly used in the focusing of raw elemental magic. 

The way that the crystal resonates with the Weave creates a direct line into the elemental planes, and artificers have recently ([[Timeline#The Age of Beginning]]) manufactured certain weapons that use this powerful leyline to fire small pellets or bolts over long distances.

Recently, Kickoff has been experiencing many raids that have halted trade to and from [[The Golden City]]. 


## Physicality of the Holding
The medium-sized city built of adobe-sand masonry. The buildings are tightly grouped together and stacked atop each other.

## Defenses
Kickoff is under the protection of the [[Golden Claws]], although they are far from [[The Golden City]]. Many people carry their own bladed weapons and / or Durandurm weaponry, as these people are quite close to the source.

## Notable Locations
- [[Kickoff's Great Durandurm Mines]]
- [[Ginger's Nopal & Agave Farm]]
- [[Tybir's Camel Ranch]]
- [[Sivir's Dwarf-Gang Bar]]
