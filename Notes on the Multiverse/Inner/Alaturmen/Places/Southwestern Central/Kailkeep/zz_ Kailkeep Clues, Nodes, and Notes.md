# Kailkeep
Big Conclusion;

These *lower levels* are a **facade** to **lure** adventurers higher up into the *Hells of Kailkeep*.

> Lower levels are a facade
- the dwarven art isnt dwarven
- these stories dont really make sense
- the monsters here are fucked up / dont want to fight
> Facade is a lure
- dwarves left behind gold and magic
- evil kobolds live above now
- a powerful entity has been trapped
