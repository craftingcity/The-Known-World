# Big City Kobolds
Kailkeep is a massive, mountain wide structure that bases much of its production and gathering in its entertainment; the Hells of Kailkeep.

Running the game may seem a difficult task on its own to some of our newest recruits (Welcome! Please find your cloaks and folder of unplayed characters in your goodie bag on your way out â€“ and please, a round of applause for reading almost the whole fucking book), and that is true - Kailkeep's Hells are a stresser for all at the table - those of us with some level of *deeper understanding of the game* (whatever that means) should be careful to expand and maintain Kailkeep well as a functioning organism.
