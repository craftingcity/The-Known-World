### Detail
#### Hall A
#### Textile Production
This room was clearly once some sort of gathering space to view speeches made from the [[b_ Chapter Three - Level Two; Line|Balcony]] above this space as evidenced by the many dozens of stools pushed and stacked into the corners of this room. Sitting on a collection of these stools are three sweaty *goblin* and one *guand* conversing in [[Draconic (language)]] about today's operations. In the center of this space, a large multi-wheel loom made of iron is being slowly operated by six *goblin* working in conjunction to form a large hempen sheet. In the corner opposing the resting creatures, two iron crates hold hempen thread and a third holds large folded hemp sheets.

#### Barracks
A series of iron bunk-beds and stuffed leather bags fill the space of this room. Hemp ropes hang from some of the bunks in this area. A pair of *guand* are cuddled in the lower bed of one of these bunks, totally asleeep.
