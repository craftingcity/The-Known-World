### Detail
#### Hall A
#### Textile Production
This room was clearly once some sort of gathering space to view speeches made from the [[b_ Chapter Three - Level Two; Line|Balcony]] above this space as evidenced by the many dozens of stools pushed and stacked into the corners of this room. Sitting on a collection of these stools are three sweaty *goblin* and one *guand* conversing in [[Draconic (language)]] about today's operations. In the center of this space, a large multi-wheel loom made of iron is being slowly operated by six *goblin* working in conjunction to form a large hempen sheet. In the corner opposing the resting creatures, two iron crates hold hempen thread and a third holds large folded hemp sheets.

#### Barracks
A series of iron bunk-beds and stuffed leather bags fill the space of this room. Hemp ropes hang from some of the bunks in this area. A pair of *guand* are snoring, cuddled in the lower bed of one of these bunks, totally asleep.

The bags are the personal affects of the workers on this level and the above. No items in these bags would be considered valuable to a munchkin, but there are many pieces of carved bone, molded cheese and bread, or hempen clothing.

#### Weapons Production
A large table at the back of this room is equipped to produce finished weaponry such as arrows, bolts, swords, axes, and shields. Nearly all of this equipment, and these tools, are made wholly of Iron. Four *goblin* and one *guand* sit on stools around this table, grabbing pieces from one iron bin, working, and putting their finished products in another.
