### Level Four: Let the Games Begin!
#### What Dwells Here?
#### Exploring this Level
There are three variations of this "floor", though room is a better descriptor. 

##### 1. Pressure
Four bowls rest on four pressure plates on their four platforms in the four corners of the room. A fine dust sits on the sandstone fixtures of this room.

**Markings.** All around the room, many etched squared surround messages in many scripts, but always dated in one.

**Dust.** A thin layer of grey dust clings to every thing in this space.

**Bowls.** Four bowls rest on raised [[#Platforms]]. They are four and one half feet in diameter, and they dip into the platform three feet. It's curvature is perfect.

**Pressure Plates.** Below the **Bowls**, in the **Platforms**, pressure plates are triggered at exactly thirty pounds of downward force, and re-triggered if the weight changes.

**Platforms.** Four unique five foot square platform-cubes extend from the floor and wall. They all hold a uniform and perfect bowl as well as art.

**Hidden Trap Door.** Hidden in the stone above the center of the room is a stone sliding trapdoor that is actuated by all four of the **Pressure Plates** triggering only once.

**Ko-bolted Door.** A mysterious door of rare and tough metal marked with a claw and a draconic rune.

###### Markings
On the floor and walls of this room there are many (at least 7) square indentations with [[Draconic (language)]] runes extended; "NO CHEAT". 

On the wall above the platform of the Kobold giving blood is a formatted marking in [[King's Common]];

On the floor in a corner of the room that is bare of other marks is an unformatted marking in [[Celestial (language)]];

> NO GREED
> NO TEMPRANCE

###### Dust
That used to be a person!

###### Bowls
These bowls are made of the same sandstone as the platforms, plates, and walls of this room. At the bottom of the bowl, the [[Draconic (language)]] rune for our understanding of ~"thirty weight".

###### Plates
The plates are set to detect thirty pounds of pressure applied directly downwards. Once all four plates are triggered at the same time, the hidden trapdoor to level five opens. If any of the pressure is altered in any way, including adding or removing any weight, the secondary trigger occurs, shutting the trap door and activating the gas trap of the **Platforms**.

###### Platforms
Each of the platforms depicts a Kobold giving something into a bowl. One shows a kobold willingly giving coins, another willingly giving food, another willingly giving their own blood, and another willingly giving books and scrolls.

At the bottom of each of the platforms are drilled grates that quickly reveal only darkness.

Along the platforms, there are small drilled holes that lead down into a tube before turning and continuing elsewhere. These have no marking or indications of any kind other than their existence.

These holes will dispense a horrible gas into the enclosed room upon the secondary trigger of the **Plates**. This gas does 1d4 poison damage and 1d4 necrotic damage. It is not flammable. It is very slightly more dense than air.

> *Trapping Efficiently*
> 
> I pretty consistently throughout my D&D experience have thought about how traps get constructed, set, and reset, especially in a "abandoned dungeon" setting. When I looked for a good source for this I become disappointed with the mild results. Traps look like stat blocks in a lot of modules, and that feels like a shame to the art-form.
> 
> Let's think about a simple spike pit. 
> I set it up by tying a rope to myself and an anchor, digging a hole, setting spikes at the bottom, and climbing out of the hole using my rope, and hiding the pit.
> 
> How would I eventually reset this? 
> 
> My pit will be too full of corpse to spike any casualties. How can I get the spikes clear? Let alone collect any loot on these corpses? 
> 
> Am I, *personally*, resetting the camouflage every time someone falls through it? No way right? Not unless it's the only option. 
> 
> I'm gonna try to make a door or something at the bottom, or actuate a piston below the spikes to raise them.
> 
> So when designing this gas trap, I was thinking about how it would be easiest to reset if the gas is just slightly heavier than air; it would collect at the floor eventually, making it easier to clear or funnel back into our reserves. 
> 
> Now I only need a bunch of tubing, a source of force for my gas, and a trigger, and I'll have a large portion of my trap reset for me with little to no work - so long as the work it took to do this over the simple spikes doesn't count for anything.
> 
> Luckily for me and Kailkeep's Kobolds, this is a very magical place, meaning that construction becomes very easy (see *stoneshape* and then imagine if it was a spell you learned from the **PRIMORDIAL IDOL OF EARTH, TERRA**), and less "preparation" work is required.

###### Hidden Trap Door
In the center of the ceiling of this room is a thin line of space between the two blocks of sandstone that form the trapdoor the mechanisms of this room engage and disengage.

###### Ko-bolted Access Door
A door in the wall made of adamentine is marked with the [[Draconic (language)]] rune that indicates our concept of "three" in the lower center of the door, and a small kobold-palm-shaped indentation marked with the same symbol on the palm, but smaller, above the rune.

##### 2. Spikes and Oil

###### Markings

###### The Spikes
Around the room in three foot intervals are rotating stone pillars with stilleto-esq blades that reach their point 5 inches out from their pillar. When some runs into these pillars, they become pierced by them; damaging them for 4d4 damage and restraining them.

###### The Oil
The Floor of this room is covered in a slick clear oil. Moving across this oil carefully requires a DC 17 check, probably a simple or proficient dexterity check or a relevant skill if you're feeling extra nice.

###### Hidden Trap Door
In the center of the ceiling of this room is a thin line of space between the two blocks of sandstone that form the trapdoor the mechanisms of this room engage and disengage.

###### Ko-bolted Access Door
A door in the wall made of adamentine is marked with the [[Draconic (language)]] rune that indicates our concept of "three" in the lower center of the door, and a small kobold-palm-shaped indentation marked with the same symbol on the palm, but smaller, above the rune.

##### 3. Sand Table
This is a timed puzzle room. On the walls there are etchings of the Mountain Kailkeep is in, and a table with a lowered center (8") that contains to its brim and overflown onto the floor - as if swiped off - a fine red sand.

###### The Sand
A 'lil bit of something for 'yah, the table holds exactly 33 pounds of dry red sand, but when the kobolds reset the room, they use units of 35, and sweep the rest onto the floor. This means that there are two "un/intentional" extra pounds of dry sand. That very quickly become wet. And or flown down to the blocked sewer **Below the Table**.

###### The Vision Columns
As the stairs close behind the poor souls given this task, the vision columns fire up, and its runes hum and generate a fine dust that swirls together to form an image of a room of Kobold. These kobold begin to, out loud, in [[Draconic (language)]], note defining features of each of the observed. After the Kobolds finish, the dust disappears and the vision fades. The **Mouths** begin to pour.

###### The Sand Table
Under the four legs of the table that holds the sand are pressure plates that are wired to detect an exact pressure-weight-degree. A cone of this dry red sand that is six inches taller than the outer edge of the table and or fourteen inches taller than the floor of the table's recess with a radius of 1.5' triggers these plates. in the center of the 8' by 5' rectangular table. This table contains a 7' by 4' by 8" recess build to contain the 33 pounds of sand found set in the table. 

This cone, when composed of entirely the dry red sand weighs 33 pounds exactly. Wet sand weighs twice as much as dry sand, meaning a cone of entirely wet sand need only be half as large â€“ but still the same dimension. When using both wet and dry sand, use your discretion, let the dice tell the story, or do a bunch of boring math in the middle of the session. One of those three is bad advice. No~! You have to guess!

###### Below the Table
Below the table is a three-foot diameter spindled adamentine grate drains into a cylinder in the floor. After two feet, this cylinder thins to two inches. A stone trap-wall closes at the same time as the stairs here, trapping the sewage from the Mouths in with those who triggered the stairs. Austensibly, a mage comes and spews water everywhere, then someone comes and resets the sand, and then the room is ready to go again.

###### The Mouths of Refuse
In each of the four ceiling-corners of the room, there are four stone statues of winged kobold sticking there, their mouths agape. After the Vision Columns are finished, the **Mouths** begin to stream a brown water into the room. This is Kailkeep's sewage. 

###### Art of Kailkeep
The Art of Kailkeep has the exact dimensions that are required for the plates below the table to trigger. 

Anyone who has a good eye for art or difference in works (or both, like a forger) would notice the softer texture of the mountain art compared to the walls of the room. 

The Kobolds had one specific idea for what this symbolizes, build this, exactly, with this soft sand from our home. Or die, in our shit.

###### Markings
There are no markings in this room. Any attempts at marking in this room are futile, if they can be refuted by an Operator, they are instantly. If they could only be removed by a power as great as Terra, then a moment passes before it is removed.

###### Hidden Trap Door
In the center of the ceiling of this room is a thin line of space between the two blocks of sandstone that form the trapdoor the mechanisms of this room engage and disengage.

###### Ko-bolted Access Door
A door in the opposite wall as the Art of Kailkeep made of adamentine is marked with the [[Draconic (language)]] rune that indicates our concept of three in the lower center of the door, and a small kobold-palm-shaped indentation marked with the same symbol on the palm, but smaller, above the rune.
