### Level One: Hook
![[KKHell - 1_Hook.png]]
#### What Dwells Here?
##### Injured or Retired Loyalists
Groups of goblin and guand work this level of the Hells for the Kobolds of Inner Kailkeep. Most of the intelligent life here has some minor physical disability â€“ anyone who could fight well would still be entertaining in the Hells. It is the security of these lower levels that is the purpose of these weaker loyalists.

All of the loyalists on this level keep a side-arm and an alert horn (generally made of ivory or iron) with them, such as a dagger or a small metal club, but the higher-grade equipment is exported or kept in the **Armory** (13) when it is not in use.

Due to their injuries, the Loyalists here will call for an alert before grouping in the **Armory** (13) and sending their strongest to hold the **Spiked Defenses** (15) and **Primary Production** (7) rooms. 

##### Unusual Rats
Unusually Large Rats are bred by the Loyalists who work this Level. Some of these Large Rats have gotten loose, and begun to move about the Lower Floors.

##### Wandering Encounters
The False Allure is very stagnant. Any wandering encounters would be composed of loose rat or moving and working retired loyalists.

#### Exploring this Level
##### Elsewhere
In many rooms on this level, "Elsewhere" is mentioned. This is a theoretical place for you to attach Kailkeep to your setting, or add your own content, if you'd like. In any case, these places need not exist if this is sounds like more work than worth to you (and call your union rep., please).

##### 1a. Guest Stairs
A twenty-five foot square room contains an ornate staircase leading from one of the many surface level entrances to Kailkeep. It has only one other point of egress, a damaged wooden door to the west.

**Staircase.** The stairs here egress to and from a finely carved tunnel on the surface of the desert leading into the mountain.

**Wall Detail.** On the eastern wall of this room, a large mural is embossed into the wall of a dwarven hand shaking a dragon-like claw with three fingers.

**Secret Door.** Hehe! I lied! A secret door of thin stone lies flush with the wall, leading to a **Ko-Bolted Door** and the **Secret Door** in the turn of the **Hallway** in of **Partmaking A** room (6a).

##### 1b. Preparation Room 
Once a room for final preparations by people before entering the common room before their king, now a alarm signal for the occupants of this place. 

**Egress.** A door of thin stone leads east to the **Guest Stairs** (1a) and another leads north to the **Hall of Departure** (2a). A portal to Elsewhere appears on this room's western wall.

**Ruined Furniture.** Rubbled stone of tables and stools are pushed into the corners of this room. These were one used for any final preparations before continuing into the "public" of the common room.

##### 1c. Hallway to Elsewhere
**DM's Choice.** This does not have to exist. If Elsewhere doesn't exist, neither do its portals.

##### 2a. Hall of Departure
This is the point at which servants would depart from their masters and join the forces of their host the King.

**Egress.** A 7' arch leads north into the **Entrance Hall** (2b). A southern thin stone door leads to the **Preparation Room** (1b) and another in the western wall leads into the servent's halls connecting to the **Entrance Hall** (2b) and **###** (27).

**Worn Carpet.** A red dyed carpet stretches from the southern door though the arch in this room and into the **Entrance Hall**.

##### 2b. Entrance Hall
This is the entrance hall to the common room. Minor nobles and the common folk would congregate through this hall to listen to the King of this place, supposedly.

**Egress.** A 7' arch fills the southern entryway, leading into the **Hall of Departure** (2a), and another greater 12' arch leads into the **King's Common Room** (3a).

**Wall Detail.** Along the eastern and western walls, dwarven-esq art displays many scenes of work, revelry, arguing, and eventually, it becomes clear that one becomes king, as he is crowned in a throne with many people bowing to him. he begins to grow old and sick as the people continue to work and revel, and they do what they can to make him happy before he leaves the people behind, taking only five others with him.

In very basic [[Dwarven (language)|Dwarven]] runes enscribed underneath each scene, a "story" is told;

> "before, six siblings 
> came here made home
> created family, grow old
> we write their stories.
> mined the mountain
> with iron and gold
> with deep above jewels
> fine craft done here.
> large home, many family
> one living sibling; king
> happy keep him
> short life he live
> honor memories of 
> all sibling-grandparents"

**Worn Carpet.** A red dyed carpet stretches from the southern arch and turns northeast in the center of this room, tapering off in strands before it can reach the **King's Common Room** (3a).

##### 3a. King's Common Room
This is the room to which the King of this place would make his speeches and the Common folk would stand or sit and listen. This room is occupied by two *goblin* working the loom and three old *goblin* conversing and sitting with two *guand* in the southeast corner of the room. A *goblin* with a crossbow loaded in hand sits on a stool fifteen feet southeast from the arch that leads to the **Entrance Hall** (2b). 

**Egress.** The doors described herein are all exactly the same. These doors are made of {an arid wood}, fine once, now rotted and worn with old age. Once, they held hinges of some metal, but now there only is a hole in the wood now. All of these doors are unmarked, other than their dwarven-esq filigree.

In the southeast, the corner forms an arch that egresses the (2b). In the southern jutty-stone-bit's western wall, a door leads to the (4b). The northwestern door leads to (25). The northeastern door leads to (22). The eastern door leads to (15).

**Furniture.** Some 30 stools made stone and wrapped in rotting furs and cloths are pushed to the edges of this chamber. In the center of this room, what used to be a nice circular rug is now rotted and ripped to strands. A iron wheel-loom stands in the center of the now-cleared space, a box of thread and yarn stands beside the loom's stone stool.

**Chandelier.** High above, in the ceiling of the floor above, a chandelier sheds down a dim warm light.

##### 3b. Ducted-Pot Chamber
**Ducted-Pot.** Its a shitter. But its made of dwarven-esq plumbing and work. It works the exact way yours does, too, weirdly enough.

##### 3c. Eyes and Ears of the King
**Secret Door.** A secret stone door sits flush with the wall of the **King's Common Chamber** (3a). A square hole about four feet from the floor is covered in a painted mesh that carefully camouflages the peep-hole this door contains.

**Stone Box-stool.** Beyond the door, a small chamber of 5 by 10 feet. A box made of stone and covered by a long rotten pile of blankets stands alone in the center of this chamber. It is two feet tall, three feet long, and one foot wide. This box has no mechanism for locking. It has stone hinges. Inside, a curved scope crafted of ruby and bronze and a bronze cone listening device.

##### 4a. Guest Servant Quarters
What was once a guest quarters for servants of visiting noble has been converted into a church-like chamber, including an altar, kneel sheets, and many lit and unlit candles.

**Altar.** A large altar composed of disassembled stone beds takes up much of the eastern half of the room. A lectern stands on its frontern center, facing out towards the many **Kneel Sheets** and the **Candles** at the back of the room.

**Kneel Sheets.** Fifteen blankets of linen and furs have been placed in front of the altar, leaving two aisles between the three rows heading toward the altar.

**Candles.** Resting in slotted stone posts are many dozens of beeswax candles. About half are currently lit.

**Wall Detail.** A long sequence of snapshot-and-caption dwarven-esq art pieces span the perimeter of this room five feet above the ground. The art shows scenes of a dwarf coordinating mining efforts throughout the mountain and dealing with the stresses of such an expedition, including monsters, explosions, and side character death. Our protagonist is lost after they heroically save many others by lifting up the ceiling during a cave in, and having their story honored in this room.

In very basic [[Dwarven (language)|Dwarven]] runes enscribed underneath each scene, a "story" is told;

> "fast digger
> strong bodied
> the quickest of us
> made more than any
> fought for us
> saved many lives
> gave too many speeches
> for their own good
> saved many with death
> holding heavy cave
> forever"

##### 4b. Servant's Hall to the King's Common Room
This hallway connects the **King's Common Room** (3a) and the **Supply Overflow** (5) room. **Bag Holding** (4c) is on the hall's turn.

##### 4c. Bag Holding
What was once meant for noble luggage is now used to store the personal items of the Inhabitants of this area.

**Shelves.** Thin shelves hold small bags of leather (about the size of a modern day "mini-backpack") in slotted stone compartmented shelves. 

Inside each of these bags are a half-eaten ration and some small collections of keepsakes; small charcoal drawings, beautiful stones, flaked tools, carved ivory figurines and dice, or other small stuff, both in value and size. No-one would appraise any individual item taken from here to be worth more than a few copper, excluding the rations, of course.

##### 5. Supply Overflow
**Egress.** On the north and south walls, on their most eastern points, a thin stone door stands in its frame.

**Shelves.** The shelves that line the western walls of this room are empty, save for a few rat droppings.

##### 6a. Partmaking A
**Hallway.** The hallway in this area connects to the **Primary Production** room (7) as well as the **Supply Overflow** room (5).

**Secret Door.** In the hallway, flush with the stone, a secret door leads to the **Guest Stairs** (1a) and a *Ko-Bolted Door*.

**Small Workshop.** This small workshop is outfitted for three people as such. The western third of this room is taken by a simple large 14.5' stone table and three stone stools half as tall as the 4' table. Many medium quality metal-working tools such as files, clamps, and hammers are carefully placed above the table on posts of stone, as well as three ivory googles.

**Weird Machine.** A large stone machine stands 3' tall 2' wide against the southern wall of this room. It's center is hollow, and the cylinder inside can be accessed by a compartment in the top of the machine as well as three large doors in the front that compose the machine's frontern wall. On its left wall, a stone button is painted orange. When this button is pressed, alchemical thermite alights and quickly heats the internal chamber of the machine.

**Instructional Artistry.** Above the **Weird Machine**, on the southern wall, many carvings make a larger instructional art-piece that shows a dwarf operating the machine and crafting sets of caltrops, arrowheads, and simple darts.


##### 6b. Partmaking B
**Small Forge.** Large chunks of a smoky black rock sizzle and pop from behind their stone wall. Attached to this small stone forge are two raised platforms, on which a slotted anvil made of stone and bronze and a bellows attached into the bottom of the pit of black rock. 
- **Anvil.** The anvil is composed mostly of stone, but is cored with bronze rods and a thick bronze plating on its working faces.
- **Bellows.** The bellows is composed of an iron frame and a tan leather bag to contain and push the air into the forge.
- **Forge.** The forge is a deep bed of lit charcoal held back by a five-inch thick wall of stone. At the base of the Forge, the Bellows is attached, and the anvil is on a raised platform close by.

**Shelves.** On small shelves across the room from the forge sit sheets of this black rock, three inches thick and nine inches square. Beside them, 1lb blocks of iron sit waiting to be worked.

##### 7. Primary Production
**Egress.** Two southern doors lead to the **Partmaking** rooms (6a & 6b), one eastern door opens to the **Hallway of Manual** (9b).

**Wierd Workshop.** The large space here is equipped with large tables and shelves of wierd tools and materials of iron and a orange powder that has no smell. The space here is occupied by 14 *goblin* and 4 *guand* working together to create weapons and ammunition from the parts they have available using these tools and creating large sparks using their tools to do so. Multiple pieces are unfinished in space.

**Valuables.** 14 finished iron arrows and 4 finished iron bolts rest in quivers at the ends of their assembly area. Two iron longswords and one unassembled battleaxe rest in a large piece of leather at the end of the workshop tables. In total there is 60 + 2d10 pounds of worked iron of many military shapes, should one consider such a thing of valuable.

##### 8a. Product Examination and Export
**Examination Table.** A table in the center of this room bears a grand stone chair, adorned in linen blankets and furs. Resting on the table is one huge piece of worn leather and a large series of magnifying lenses.

**Shelves.** Many bundles of weapons wrapped in large leathers are stacked on the shelves here. Quivers of iron arrows and bolts rest hanging from the poles of the iron shelves.

**Ko-Bolted Door.** A large door composed of adamentine takes up only a small doorway in the southern wall of this room. It is embossed with a small three-clawed hand-print and deeper with a draconic rune reading "one".

##### 8b. Hallway with Stairs
**Hallway.** This hallway links the **Production Examination and Export** (8a) and **Fine Production** (9a) rooms with a set of stairs that lead upwards to the ###### room ().

##### 9a. Fine Production
**Egress.** Two creaky wooden doors lead west, the northern of which leads to the **Hallway of Manual** (9b), and the southern to the **Hallway with Stairs** (8b). A 6' arch leads north, to the **Hallway and Dry Feed Storage** (9c).

**Fine Workshop.** This space is equipped with table, stool, and tools for three people to work together to cut gems and create fine jewelry of gold and silver. A large stone work-table and three stools take most of the space in the southern half of the room. Three *goblin* sit and work at the large table in this southern half of the room, chatting quietly among themselves. There are some stores of 1lb gold bars and large uncut ruby, emerald, and sapphire (perhaps 2d6-1 each?).

**Lone Chair.** A lone stone stool backed against the wall creates a simple chair. Worn furs and cloths lay on the seat. Atop the seat, a *goblin* sits, crossbow in hand, fast asleep. A quiver of six steel bolts leans against the legs of the stool.

##### 9b. Hallway of Manual
**Hallway.** This hallway connects the **Primary Production** room with the **Fine Production** room, and taking a sharp left sends you through the arch towards the **Supplies Import** room.

**Instructional Artistry.** Through the entirety of the hall, instructional art of a dwarf creating weapons is carved into one wall and this same dwarf creating jewelry on the other wall.

##### 9c. Hallway and Dry Feed Storage
**Hallway.** This hallway connects the **Fine Production** room (9a) and the **Supplies Import** room (10a). Directly opposing the southern door of the **Supplies Import**, a twenty-foot-long rotating storage rack is attached to the ceiling by thick wire.

**Large Storage Rack.** A large metal rack on the ceiling hangs dozens of hooks below it, on each of which is a leather bag, plump mixtures of dry mushroom and beans. If your adventurers stop and collect each and every bag, they will find 36 + 2d4 leather bags, each of which contain one and one-half day's "rations" (less than two pounds of each foodstuff, mixed at about 50:50 ratio, boil with spice and bonuses for six to ten minutes, serve with bread and cheese).

##### 10a. Supplies Import
**Platforms.** Raised six-inch square platforms of stone about four and one half feet wide. Some brown and white dusts can be found on these platforms, as well as the scent of mushrooms (DC ~20). 

**Shelves.** Shelves hold multiple latticed stone baskets that are each three feet cubes with open tops. They are each labeled on the bases of each of the four sides of the basket in [[Draconic]] for iron, silver, gold, ruby, emerald, and sapphire. The baskets of marked of iron, gold, and each of the gems are empty. The basket marked for silver is 2/3rds full of 1lb silver bars.

##### 10b. Cooling Chamber
**Stone Coolers.** Six stone boxes with thin slits in their lid contain large blocks of ice and slush. These small three foot cubes of stone and ice cool this room and the adjoined (17) to temperatures that fluctuate around thirty three degrees.

**Thin Ducts.** In the northern wall of the chamber, thin slits in the rock form vents between the adjoining chamber.

##### 11. Dry Storage
Other than the *Large Shelves*, this room bares no defining features.

**Large Shelves.** Shelves of hemp and linen bags labeled by black runes in [[Draconic]] line each of the four corners of this room. Each is full of dry goods, 8 pound bags of mushrooms, beans, flour, sugar, powdered meat, and onions are stacked on these shelves, and one could find 1d6-2 of each if they were to spend the time searching every shelf.

##### 12. Water Storage
**Egress.** Two 7' arches pierce the western and southern walls. The western archway splits into a hallway, leading to the Sauce Preparation room (13) directly west or the Primary Production room (7) to the south west. The southern arch leads to two staircases, both of which lead upwards ==(northern; , western;)==.  A thin stone door is ajar in the northern doorway, leading into a dark room (11).

**In-Wall Tank.** Extending out from where the southern and eastern walls would meet is a 2.5' diameter stone barrel-tank built out from the wall, four and a half feet above the ground. It's height reaches the ceiling. At the barrels' edge, a spigot rests, closed. A thin window of transparent white stone extends upward from the lowest point of the barrel wall, displaying the water inside the barrel. It is currently 3/4ths full (15 gallons) of clean, potable water.

**Shitty Wooden Barrels.** Barrels made of old wooden shields disassembled leak water slowly onto the floor here, making the area around them slick with algae. While these barrels are all also 3/4ths full of water, it is less than clean. In its current state, a failure of a DC 13 CON check upsets the drinker's weak stomach, leading to a condition or some amount of damage (I'd go with like 2d4+2. Bad water fucking sucks). 

##### 13. Armory
**Iron Cabinets.** Collected into quivers of the appropriate sizes, bundles of 20 bolts and arrows of iron are stored here, long with their bow and crossbow counterparts. In total, 4 sets are stored in these two cabinets.

**Racks.** In iron weapon racks, many weapons are held. Sharpened iron poles form spears, longswords of forged iron, war-picks of the same. 

##### 14. Storage Hallway
##### 15. Spiked Defenses
**Stationary Spikes.** Large sharpened iron spike-walls line the south-west and northern walls. Anyone pushed into these spikes must make a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage. Those who failed take a full 3d6 piercing damage.

##### 16a. Supplementary Kitchen
**Large Water Purification System.** A large stone system of tubing and chambers takes up the northwestern corner of the room.

**Shitty Wooden Barrels.** Barrels made of old wooden shields disassembled leak water slowly onto the floor here, making the area around them slick with algae. While these barrels are all also 3/4ths full of water, it is less than clean. In its current state, a failure of a DC 13 CON check upsets the drinker's weak stomach, leading to a condition or some amount of damage (I'd go with like 2d4+2. Bad water fucking sucks).

##### 16b. Quick Access Food Storage a	`1																																											nd Hallway
**Hallway.** This hallway connects the **Cold Storage** room and the **Supplementary Kitchen**, as well as serving for a good location to store the *Food Cart*.

**Food Cart.** A thin and tall wheeled stone cart contains many ceramic bottles of sauce and oil and iron bins of ingredients.

##### 17. Cold Storage Room 
**Meat Hooks.** Many large dressed corpses rest on hooks hanging from mounts in the ceiling in this room. There are over 400 pounds of meat is held frozen in this room. Of what type, that is not hard to determine; there are three humanoid corpses for every two large animal corpses (such as cattle, horses, camel, large goat or sheep).

**Butcher's Table.** In the center of this room, there is a large stone table that holds a thick wooden board that has been cut into thousands of times by the cleaver that now rests in the wood of the table again.

**Shelves.** Resting on the shelves of this room, there are shoddy iron buckets with ceramic interiors full of frozen blood and organs, such as liver, spleen, and heart, at about a 30:70 ratio.

##### 18. Greater Kitchen
**Cooking Bed.** A large stone pit of hot coals stands in the center of this room. Hanging above it, many cooking spits, pots, and pans rest above the coals.

**Preparation Tables.** The four stone tables with wooden boards indented flush have been cut upon thousands of times. There are two other stone tables that do not have these boards, and are more commonly used for resting or larger dishes.

**Spice Rack.** Hanging above the preparation tables are thin spice racks with small ceramic jars resting inside. Each have a dwarven rune that reads one of the following; "salt", "pepper", "cumin", "paprika", "teriyaki mix".

##### 22. Staircase
**Staircase.**
**Wall Detail.**
##### 23. Minor Storage
**Crates.** Pushed against one another and stacked atop eachother, many crates containing many raw goods (see **Major Storage** for details).
##### 24. Major Storage
**Tool Rack.** Hanging from the a rack mounted into the wall, many tools of work are placed delicately on pegs extending from a massive iron sheet mounted into the rock, although most of the pegs are empty - perhaps they are being used or held elsewhere?

**Crates.** Four-foot cube crates of iron store many life-goods, such as pottery, rope, leathers, linen, as well as many forms of raw material like feathers, glass, and wrapped pounds of clay.

Should your adventurers wish to gather all of the items in these crates, they will find way too much to carry, but almost any basic material they could be looking for sans anything made of wood.

**Shelves.** Stacked upon shelves are many hemp and linen bags of food goods (see *Dry Storage* for more details), as well as many folded linen blankets and stacked pillows.

##### 25. Servant Preparation Chamber
**Wardrobes.**

##### 26a. Rough Barracks
**Bunks.**
##### 26b. Fine Barracks
**Beds.**
