### Level One: Hook
![[KKHell - 1_Hook.png]]
#### What Dwells Here?
##### Injured or Retired Loyalists
Groups of Goblin, Guand, and other Loyalists work this level of the Hells for the Kobolds of Inner Kailkeep. Most of the intelligent life here has some minor physical disability â€“ anyone who could fight well would still be entertaining in the Hells. It is the security of these lower levels that is the purpose of these weaker loyalists.

##### Unusual Rats
Unusually Large Rats are bred by the Loyalists who work this Level. Some of these Large Rats have gotten loose, and begun to move about the Lower Floors.

##### Wandering Encounters
The False Allure is very stagnant. Any wandering encounters would be composed of loose rat or moving and working retired loyalists.

#### Exploring this Level
In many rooms on this level, "Elsewhere" is mentioned. This is a theoretical place for you to attach Kailkeep to your setting, or add your own content, if you'd like. In any case, these places need not exist if this is sounds like more work than its work

##### 1a. Guest Stairs

**Egress.**
**Staircase.**
**Wall Detail.**

##### 1b. Preparation Room 


**Egress.**
**Furniture.**

##### 1c. Hallway to Elsewhere

**DM's Choice.** This does not have to exist. If Elsewhere doesnt exist, neither do its portals.

##### 2a. Hall of Departure

##### 2b. Entrance Hall

##### 3a. King's Common Room
This is the room to which the King of this place would make his speeches and the Common folk would stand or sit and listen.

**Egress.** The doors described herein are all exactly the same. These doors are made of {an arid wood}, fine once, now rotted and worn with old age. Once, they held hinges of some metal, but now there only is a hole in the wood now. All of these doors are unmarked, other than their dwarven-esq filigree.

In the southeast, the corner forms an arch that egresses the [[#2b Entrance Hall]]. In the southern jutty-stone-bit's western wall, a door leads to the [[#4b Servant's Hall to the King's Common Room]]. The northwestern door leads to [[]]. The northeastern door leads to [[]]. The eastern door leads to [[]].

**Furniture.** Some 30 stools made stone and wrapped in rotting furs and cloths are pushed to the edges of this chamber. In the center of this room, what used to be a nice circular rug is now rotted and ripped to strands.

**Chandelier.** High above, in the ceiling of the floor above, a chandelier sheds down a dim warm light.

##### 3b. Ducted-Pot Chamber
**Ducted-Pot.** Its a shitter. But its made of dwarven-esq plumbing and work. It works the exact way yours does, too, weirdly enough.

##### 3c. Eyes and Ears of the King
**Secret Door.**

**Stone Box-stool.** Beyond the door, a small chamber of 5 by 10 feet. A box made of stone and covered by a long rotten pile of blankets stands alone in the center of this chamber. It is two feet tall, three feet long, and one foot wide. This box has no mechanism for locking. It has stone hinges. Inside, a curved scope crafted of ruby and bronze and a bronze cone listening device.

##### 4a. Guest Servant Quarters
##### 4b. Servant's Hall to the King's Common Room
##### 4c. Bag Holding
##### 5. Supply Overflow
##### 6a. Partmaking A
**Small Workshop.** This small workshop is outfitted for three people as such. The western third of this room is taken by a simple large 14.5' stone table and three stone stools half as tall as the 4' table. Many medium quality metal-working tools such as files, clamps, and hammers are carefully placed above the table on posts of stone, as well as three ivory googles.

**Weird Machine.** A large stone machine stands 3' tall 2' wide against the southern wall of this room. It's center is hollow, and the cylinder inside can be accessed by a compartment in the top of the machine as well as three large doors in the front that compose the machine's frontern wall. On its left wall, a stone button is painted orange. When this button is pressed, alchemical thermite alights and quickly heats the internal chamber of the machine.

**Instructional Artistry.** Above the **Weird Machine**, on the southern wall, many carvings make a larger instructional art-piece that shows a dwarf operating the machine and crafting sets of caltrops, arrowheads, and simple darts.

##### 6b. Partmaking B
**Small Forge.** Large chunks of a smoky black rock sizzle and pop from behind their stone wall. Attached to this small stone forge are two raised platforms, on which a slotted anvil made of stone and bronze and a bellows attatched into the bottom of the pit of black rock. 
- **Anvil.**
- **Bellows.**
- **Forge.**

**Shelves.** On small shelves across the room from the forge sit sheets of this black rock, three inches thick and nine inches square. Beside them, blocks of iron sit waiting to be worked.

##### 7. Primary Production
**Egress.**
**Workshop.** 
**Valuables.**

##### 8a. Product Examination and Export
**Examination Table.**
**Storage Shelves.**
**Valuables.**
**Ko-Bolted Door.**

##### 8b. Hallway with Stairs
This hallway links the **Production Examination and Export** (8a) and **Fine Production** (9a) rooms with a set of stairs that lead upwards ().

##### 9a. Fine Production
**Egress.**
**Fine Workshop.**
**Lone Chair.**

##### 9b. Hallway of Manual
**Hallway.** This hallway connects the **Primary Production** room with the **Fine Production** room, and taking a sharp left sends you through the arch towards the **Supplies Import** room.

**Instructional Artistry.** Through the entirety of the hall, instructional art of a dwarf creating weapons is carved into one wall and this same dwarf creating jewelry on the other wall.

##### 9c. Hallway and Dry Feed Storage
**Hallway.** This hallway connects the **Fine Production** room (9a) and the **Supplies Import** room (10a). Directly opposing the southern door of the **Supplies Import**, a twenty-foot-long rotating storage rack is attached to the ceiling by thick wire.

**Large Storage Track.** A large metal rack on the ceiling hangs dozens of hooks below it, on each of which is a leather bag, plump mixtures of dry mushroom and beans. If your adventurers stop and collect each and every bag, they will find 36 + 2d4 leather bags, each of which contain one and one-half day's "rations" (less than two pounds of each foodstuff, mixed at about 50:50 ratio, boil with spice and bonuses for six to ten minutes, serve with bread and cheese).

##### 10a. Supplies Import
**Platforms.** Raised six-inch square platforms of stone about four and one half feet wide. Some brown and white dusts can be found on these platforms, as well as the scent of mushrooms (DC ~20). 
**Shelves.** 

##### 10b. Cooling Chamber
**Thin Ducts.**
**Ice Chambers.**
##### 11. Dry Storage
Other than the *Large Shelves* in this room, it bares no defining features.

**Large Shelves.** Shelves of hemp and linen bags labeled by black runes in [[Draconic]] line each of the four corners of this room. Each is full of dry goods, 8 pound bags of mushrooms, beans, flour, sugar, powdered meat, and onions are stacked on these shelves, and one could find 1d6-2 of each if they were to spend the time searching every shelf.

##### 12. Water Storage
**Egress.** Two 7' arches pierce the western and southern walls. The western archway splits into a hallway, leading to the Sauce Preparation room (13) directly west or the Primary Production room (7) to the south west. The southern arch leads to two staircases, both of which lead upwards ==(northern; , western;)==.  A thin stone door is ajar in the northern doorway, leading into a dark room (11).

**In-Wall Tank.** Extending out from where the southern and eastern walls would meet is a 2.5' diameter stone barrel-tank built out from the wall, four and a half feet above the ground. It's height reaches the ceiling. At the barrels' edge, a spigot rests, closed. A thin window of transparent white stone extends upward from the lowest point of the barrel wall, displaying the water inside the barrel. It is currently 3/4ths full (15 gallons) of clean, potable water.

**Shitty Wooden Barrels.** Barrels made of old wooden shields disassembled leak water slowly onto the floor here, making the area around them slick with algae. While these barrels are all also 3/4ths full of water, it is less than clean. In its current state, a failure of a DC 13 CON check upsets the drinker's weak stomach, leading to a condition or some amount of damage (I'd go with like 2d4+2. Bad water fucking sucks).
