### Level One: Hook
#### What Dwells Here?
##### Injured or Retired Loyalists
Groups of Goblin and Gaund live and work here producing weapons and ammunition, and staying out of the way of any newcomers that make there way here.

##### Unusual Rats
Unusually Large Rats are bred by the Loyalists who work this Level. Some of these Large Rats have gotten loose, and begun to move about the Lower Floors.

##### Wandering Encounters
The False Allure is very stagnant. Any wandering encounters would be composed of loose rat or moving and working retired loyalists.

#### Exploring this Level
In many rooms on this level, "Elsewhere" is mentioned. This is a theoretical place for you to attach Kailkeep to your setting, or add your own content, if you'd like. In any case, these places need not exist if this is sounds like more work than worth to you (and call your union rep., please).

##### 1a. Guest Stairs
A twenty-five foot square room contains an ornate staircase leading from one of the many surface level entrances to Kailkeep. It has only one other point of egress, a damaged wooden door to the west.

**Staircase.**
**Wall Detail.**
**Secret Door.**

##### 1b. Preparation Room 
Once a room for final preparations by people before entering the common room before their king, now a alarm signal for the occupants of this place. 

**Egress.**
**Furniture.**
**Alarm.**

##### 1c. Hallway to Elsewhere
**DM's Choice.** This does not have to exist. If Elsewhere doesnt exist, neither do its portals.

##### 2a. Hall of Departure
This is the point at which servants would depart from their masters and join the forces of their host the King.
**Egress.**
**Worn Carpet.**

##### 2b. Entrance Hall

##### 3a. King's Common Room
This is the room to which the King of this place would make his speeches and the Common folk would stand or sit and listen.

**Egress.** 

In the southeast, the corner forms an arch that egresses the (2b). In the southern jutty-stone-bit's western wall, a door leads to the (4b). The northwestern door leads to (25). The northeastern door leads to (22). The eastern door leads to (15).

**Furniture.** Some 30 stools made stone and wrapped in rotting furs and cloths are pushed to the edges of this chamber. In the center of this room, what used to be a nice circular rug is now rotted and ripped to strands. Four hand looms sit together in the center of this chamber.

**Chandelier.** High above, in the ceiling of the floor above, a chandelier sheds down a dim warm light.

##### 3b. Ducted-Pot Chamber
**Ducted-Pot.** Its a shitter. But its made of dwarven-esq plumbing and work. It works the exact way yours does, too, weirdly enough.

##### 3c. Eyes and Ears of the King
**Secret Door.**

**Stone Box-stool.** Beyond the door, a small chamber of 5 by 10 feet. A box made of stone and covered by a long rotten pile of blankets stands alone in the center of this chamber. It is two feet tall, three feet long, and one foot wide. This box has no mechanism for locking. It has stone hinges. Inside, a curved scope crafted of ruby and bronze and a bronze cone listening device.

##### 4a. Guest Servant Quarters
##### 4b. Servant's Hall to the King's Common Room
This hallway connects the **King's Common Room** (3a) and the **Supply Overflow** (5) room. **Bag Holding** (4c) is on the hall's turn.

##### 4c. Bag Holding
What was once meant for noble luggage is now used to store the personal items of the Inhabitants of this area.

**Shelves.** Thin shelves hold small bags of leather (about the size of a modern day "mini-backpack") in slotted stone compartmented shelves. 

Inside each of these bags are a half-eaten ration and some small collections of keepsakes; small charcoal drawings, beautiful stones, flaked tools, carved ivory figurines and dice, or other small stuff, both in value and size. No-one would appraise any individual item taken from here to be worth more than a few copper, excluding the rations, of course.

##### 5. Supply Overflow
**Egress.** On the north and south walls, on their most eastern points, a thin stone door stands in its frame.

**Shelves.** The shelves that line the western walls of this room are empty, save for a few rat droppings.

##### 6a. Partmaking A
**Small Workshop.** This small workshop is outfitted for three people to work together to work iron. The western third of this room is taken by a simple large 14.5' stone table and three stone stools half as tall as the 4' table. Many medium quality metal-working tools such as files, clamps, and hammers are carefully placed above the table on posts of stone, as well as three ivory googles.

**Weird Machine.** A large stone machine stands 3' tall 2' wide against the southern wall of this room. It's center is hollow, and the cylinder inside can be accessed by a compartment in the top of the machine as well as three large doors in the front that compose the machine's frontern wall. On its left wall, a stone button is painted orange. When this button is pressed, alchemical thermite alights and quickly heats the internal chamber of the machine.

**Instructional Artistry.** Above the **Weird Machine**, on the southern wall, many carvings make a larger instructional art-piece that shows a dwarf operating the machine and crafting sets of caltrops, arrowheads, and simple darts.

**Secret Door.** In the hall leading north, a secret door connects to the **Guest Stairs** (1a).

##### 6b. Partmaking B
**Small Forge.** Large chunks of a smoky black rock sizzle and pop from behind their stone wall. Attached to this small stone forge are two raised platforms, on which a slotted anvil made of stone and bronze and a bellows attached into the bottom of the pit of black rock. 

**Shelves.** On small shelves across the room from the forge sit sheets of this black rock, three inches thick and nine inches square. Beside them, blocks of iron sit waiting to be worked.

##### 7. Primary Production
**Egress.** Two doors lead south to the **Partmaking** rooms (6 a & b). Another door leads north, into the western egress of the **Water Storage** room (12). Another still leads east, into the **Hallway of Manual** (9b).

**Workshop.** A large set of stone tables and stools takes up the center of this room, and the walls are lined in workbenches. This area is equipped to have twelve workers at any one time working either alone or in pairs to create martial goods.

##### 8a. Product Examination and Export
**Examination Table.** A small stone table sits in the center of the room, a stool well adorned in linen blankets accompany it. Standing on the table is a mounted lens of magnification and a long burnt candle in its small holder.

**Shelves.** Weaponry fills the shelves here - well stored in accompanying sheaths or quivers.

**Ko-Bolted Door.** In the southwestern corner of the room, plain as day, a Ko-Bolted door of adamentine stands imposingly, it's three clawed indent posing a deadly question; what comes out of this door?

##### 8b. Hallway with Stairs
**Hallway.** This hallway links the **Production Examination and Export** (8a) and **Fine Production** (9a) rooms with a set of stairs that lead upwards to the ###### room ().

##### 9a. Fine Production
**Egress.** Two creaky wooden doors lead west, the northern of which leads to the **Hallway of Manual** (9b), and the southern to the **Hallway with Stairs** (8b). A 6' arch leads north, to the **Hallway and Dry Feed Storage** (9c).

**Fine Workshop.** This space is equipped with table, stool, and tools for three people to work together to cut gems and create fine jewelry of gold and silver. A large stone work-table and three stools take most of the space in the southern half of the room. Three *goblin* sit and work at the large table in this southern half of the room, chatting quietly among themselves. There are some stores of 1lb gold bars and uncut ruby, emerald, and sapphire (perhaps 2d6-1 each?).

**Lone Chair.** A lone stone stool backed against the wall creates a simple chair. Worn furs and cloths lay on the seat. Atop the seat, a *goblin* sits, crossbow in hand, fast asleep. A quiver of six steel bolts leans against the legs of the stool.

##### 9b. Hallway of Manual
**Hallway.** This hallway connects the **Primary Production** room with the **Fine Production** room, and taking a sharp left sends you through the arch towards the **Supplies Import** room.

**Instructional Artistry.** Through the entirety of the hall, instructional art of a dwarf creating weapons is carved into one wall and this same dwarf creating jewelry on the other wall.

##### 9c. Hallway and Dry Feed Storage
**Hallway.** This hallway connects the **Fine Production** room (9a) and the **Supplies Import** room (10a). Directly opposing the southern door of the **Supplies Import**, a twenty-foot-long rotating storage rack is attached to the ceiling by thick wire.

**Large Storage Track.** A large metal rack on the ceiling hangs dozens of hooks below it, on each of which is a leather bag, plump mixtures of dry mushroom and beans. If your adventurers stop and collect each and every bag, they will find 36 + 2d4 leather bags, each of which contain one and one-half day's "rations" (less than two pounds of each foodstuff, mixed at about 50:50 ratio, boil with spice and bonuses for six to ten minutes, serve with bread and cheese).

##### 10a. Supplies Import
**Platforms.** Raised six-inch square platforms of stone about four and one half feet wide. Some brown and white dusts can be found on these platforms, as well as the scent of mushrooms (DC ~20). 

**Shelves.** Shelves hold multiple latticed stone baskets that are each three feet cubes with open tops. They are each labeled on the bases of each of the four sides of the basket in [[Draconic (language)]] for iron, silver, gold, ruby, emerald, and sapphire. The baskets of marked of iron, gold, and each of the gems are empty. The basket marked for silver is 2/3rds full of 1lb silver bars.

##### 10b. Cooling Chamber
**Stone Coolers.** Six stone boxes with thin slits in their lid contain large blocks of ice and slush. These small three foot cubes of stone and ice cool this room and the adjoined (17) to temperatures that fluctuate around thirty three degrees.

**Thin Ducts.** In the northern wall of the chamber, thin slits in the rock form vents between the adjoining chamber.

##### 11. Dry Storage
Other than the *Large Shelves*, this room bares no defining features.

**Large Shelves.** Shelves of hemp and linen bags labeled by black runes in [[Draconic (language)]] line each of the four corners of this room. Each is full of dry goods, 8 pound bags of mushrooms, beans, flour, sugar, powdered meat, and onions are stacked on these shelves, and one could find 1d6-2 of each if they were to spend the time searching every shelf.

##### 12. Water Storage
**Egress.** Two 7' arches pierce the western and southern walls. The western archway splits into a hallway, leading to the Sauce Preparation room (13) directly west or the Primary Production room (7) to the south west. The southern arch leads to two staircases, both of which lead upwards ==(northern; , western;)==.  A thin stone door is ajar in the northern doorway, leading into a dark room (11).

**In-Wall Tank.** Extending out from where the southern and eastern walls would meet is a 2.5' diameter stone barrel-tank built out from the wall, four and a half feet above the ground. It's height reaches the ceiling. At the barrels' edge, a spigot rests, closed. A thin window of transparent white stone extends upward from the lowest point of the barrel wall, displaying the water inside the barrel. It is currently 3/4ths full (15 gallons) of clean, potable water.

**Shitty Wooden Barrels.** Barrels made of old wooden shields disassembled leak water slowly onto the floor here, making the area around them slick with algae. While these barrels are all also 3/4ths full of water, it is less than clean. In its current state, a failure of a DC 13 CON check upsets the drinker's weak stomach, leading to a condition or some amount of damage (I'd go with like 2d4+2. Bad water fucking sucks).

##### 13. Armory
**Iron Cabinets.** In iron cabinets around this room, multiple sets of weaponry in good condition including bow & arrow, crossbow & bolt, and spear & shield.

**Shelves.** On the many shelves of this room, linen bags of dry goods (10 lb), iron-ceramic kegs of water (1 gal each), and many surplus quivers of bolts and arrows.

##### 14. Storage Hallway
**Thin Cart.** A thin stone cart on wheels slides in and out of the southern recess in this area. Shelves on this cart are overflowing with dirty dishes and utensils.

##### 15. Spiked Defenses
**Spiked Corners.** In the northeastern and southwestern corners of this room, tall spike barricades of iron rest in this otherwise unoccupied room.

##### 16a. Supplementary Kitchen
**Large Water Purification System.** A large stone system of tubing and chambers takes up the northwestern corner of the room.

**Shitty Wooden Barrels.** Barrels made of old wooden shields disassembled leak water slowly onto the floor here, making the area around them slick with algae. While these barrels are all also 3/4ths full of water, it is less than clean. In its current state, a failure of a DC 13 CON check upsets the drinker's weak stomach, leading to a condition or some amount of damage (I'd go with like 2d4+2. Bad water fucking sucks).

##### 16b. Quick Access Food Storage and Hallway
**Hallway.**

**Food Cart.**  A thin stone cart on wheels slides in and out of the recess in this area. Shelves on this cart hold ceramic bins that hold selections of foods that are usually held in the **Cold Storage** room (17).

##### 17. Cold Storage Room
**Meat Hooks.** On many hooks hanging from the ceiling of this room are dressed corpses, both humanoid and otherwise. Overall, there is about 800 lbs of meat here, but only about a third of that would serve well for those with moral stomachs.

**Butcher's Table.** A large stone table is stained with blood in the northeastern corner of this room. Many cuts on its surface indicate years if not decades of use.

**Shelves.** On the shelves of this area, racks of ceramic risers divide groups of raw vegetables kept here. Closed and stacked ceramic pots hold goat's milk and cheese. Wrapped in hemp sheets, cuts of meat lay stacked on the bottom shelves.

The shelves are in total 1/3rd full of fresh produce.

##### 18. Greater Kitchen
**Hearth.** A large central hearth warms the kitchen. Above it pans and pots hang on iron hooks, most of which are filled with a dank stew-like substance.

**Preparation Table.** A large stone table spans the northern wall of this room, knives and spoons and other utensils strewn about its face. It is dirty, brown, green, and red stains the every surface.

**Spice Rack.** Above the large *preparation table* against the northern wall is a large iron spice rack that holds glass vials of various spices from around the world.

##### 22. Staircase
**Staircase.** A staircase of stone leads upwards into the ### room ().

**Wall Detail.** On the wall opposite the stairs, a dwarven-esq mural presents a Kailkeep as the dwarves could make it be - a large stronghold - excavated and powerful. Below the mural, dwarven runes state; "As it should be".

##### 23. Minor Storage
**Crates.** Pushed against one another and stacked atop each other, many crates containing many raw goods (see **Major Storage** for details).

##### 24. Major Storage
**Tool Rack.** Hanging from the a rack mounted into the wall, many tools of work are placed delicately on pegs extending from a massive iron sheet mounted into the rock, although most of the pegs are empty - perhaps they are being used or held elsewhere?

**Crates.** Four-foot cube crates of iron store many life-goods, such as pottery, rope, leathers, linen, as well as many forms of raw material like feathers, glass, and wrapped pounds of clay.

Should your adventurers wish to gather all of the items in these crates, they will find way too much to carry, but almost any basic material they could be looking for sans anything made of wood.

**Shelves.** Stacked upon shelves are many hemp and linen bags of food goods (see *Dry Storage* for more details), as well as many folded linen blankets and stacked pillows.

##### 25. Servant Preparation Chamber
**Wardrobes.** Wardrobes of stone hold many blankets and sheets of linen.

##### 26a. Rough Barracks
**Bunks.** Stone bunks fill the space here. Many leather, linen, or hemp bags are stuffed under beds or blankets atop them. The beds here are disheveled and unkempt.

##### 26b. Fine Barracks
**Beds.**
##### 26c. Hallway to Elsewhere
**DM's Choice.** This does not have to exist. If Elsewhere doesnt exist, neither do its portals.

##### 26d. Supply Import
**Ko-Bolted Door.**
**Platform.**
**Shelves.**

##### 27. Organization Chamber
**Desk.** Stacked neatly atop the desk are many forms hand written on thin tan leathers in a black-red ink. A quill and ink-pot rests next to a blank stack of these leather papyrus.
