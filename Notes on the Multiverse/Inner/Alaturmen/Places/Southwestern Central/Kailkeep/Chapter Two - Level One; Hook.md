### Level One: Hook
![[KKHell - 1_Hook.png]]
#### What Dwells Here?
##### Injured or Retired Loyalists
Groups of Goblin, Guand, and other Loyalists work this level of the Hells for the Kobolds of Inner Kailkeep. Most of the intelligent life here has some minor physical disability â€“ anyone who could fight well would still be entertaining in the Hells. It is the security of these lower levels that is the purpose of these weaker loyalists.

##### Unusual Rats
Unusually Large Rats are bred by the Loyalists who work this Level. Some of these Large Rats have gotten loose, and begun to move about the Lower Floors.

##### Wandering Encounters
The False Allure is very stagnant. Any wandering encounters would be composed of loose rat or moving and working retired loyalists.

##### 3a. King's Common Room
This is the room to which the King of this place would make his speeches and the Common folk would stand or sit and listen.

**Egress.** The doors described herein are all exactly the same. These doors are made of {an arid wood}, fine once, now rotted and worn with old age. Once, they held hinges of some metal, but now there only is a hole in the wood now. All of these doors are unmarked, other than their dwarven-esq filigree.

In the southeast, the corner forms an arch that egresses the [[#2b Entrance Hall]]. In the southern jutty-stone-bit's western wall, a door leads to the [[#4b Servant's Hall to the King's Common Room]]. The northwestern door leads to [[#25]]. The northeastern door leads to [[#22]]. The eastern door leads to [[#15]].

**Furniture.** Some 30 stools made stone and wrapped in rotting furs and cloths are pushed to the edges of this chamber. In the center of this room, what used to be a nice circular rug is now rotted and ripped to strands.

**Chandelier.** High above, in the ceiling of the floor above, a chandelier sheds down a dim warm light.

##### 3b. Ducted-Pot Chamber
**Ducted-Pot.** Its a shitter. But its made of dwarven-esq plumbing and work. It works, too.

##### 3c. Eyes and Ears of the King
**Secret Door.**

**Stone Box-stool.** Beyond the door, a small chamber of 5 by 10 feet. A box made of stone and covered by a long rotten pile of blankets stands alone in the center of this chamber. It is two feet tall, three feet long, and one foot wide. This box has no mechanism for locking. It has stone hinges. Inside, a curved scope crafted of ruby and bronze and a bronze cone listening device.

**In-Wall Tank.** Extending out from where the southern and eastern walls would meet is a 2.5' diameter stone barrel-tank built out from the wall, four and a half feet above the ground. It's height reaches the ceiling. At the barrels' edge, a spigot rests, closed. A thin window of transparent white stone extends upward from the lowest point of the barrel wall, displaying the water inside the barrel. It is currently 3/4ths full (15 gallons) of clean, potable water.
**Shitty Wooden Barrels.** Barrels made of old wooden shields disassembled leak water slowly onto the floor here, making the area around them slick with algae. While these barrels are all also 3/4ths full of water, it is less than clean. In its current state, a failure of a
