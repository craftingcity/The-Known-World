#### What Dwells Here?
##### Injured or Retired Loyalists
Groups of Goblin and Gaund live and work here producing weapons and ammunition, and staying out of the way of any newcomers that make there way here.

##### Unusual Rats
Unusually Large Rats are bred by the Loyalists who work this Level. Some of these Large Rats have gotten loose, and begun to move about the Lower Floors.

##### Wandering Encounters
The False Allure is very stagnant. Any wandering encounters would be composed of loose rat or moving and working retired loyalists.
