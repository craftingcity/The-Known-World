# Description
Kickoff's main industry is mining and exporting Durandurm crystal, a powerful magical component; beautiful clear crystal that is most commonly used in the focusing of raw elemental magic. 

The way that the crystal resonates with the Weave creates a direct line into the elemental planes, and artificers have recently ([[Timeline#The Age of Beginning]]) manufactured certain weapons that use this powerful leyline to fire small pellets and rocks over long distances.

The flux of prosperity has been halted short by the ongoing raids of [[The Outlands]] by its [[The Outlands#Nomad Tribes|Nomad Tribes]] and the [[The Outlands#Thieves|Thieves Guilds]].


## Physicality of the Holding
The medium sized city built of adobe-sand masonry. The buildings are tightly grouped together and stacked atop each other.

## Defenses
Kickoff is under the protection of the [[Golden Claws]], although they are far from [[The Golden City]]. Many people carry their own bladed weapons (or, in the case of the Durandurm-powered ranged weaponry.
