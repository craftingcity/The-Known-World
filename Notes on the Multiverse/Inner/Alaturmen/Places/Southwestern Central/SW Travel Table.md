# South Western Central Alaturmen
Much of the South West is civilized. The outskirts of this area are densely inhabited by human, gnoll, goblin, and many native fauna. Nearly the only recognized organization here is [[The Golden City]], as ruled by the [[Golden Claws]], but the [[Desert Thieves]] hold the outskirts where they can.

How many? How big is it / are they? How badly do they need it? Why is that interesting to the players and their characters?
