### Scenarios
#### AL3. Southern Geyser Fields
	- A massive "forest" of hot water geysers. This place was once fought over by Cobalt's Theives, Golden Claws, and a passing nomad tribe.
	- A compound of old wood buildings holds 7 well equipped Noble Theives loyal to Cobalt, all of whom are willing to defend this necessary resource with their lives.
#### AM9. Temple of the Golomancer
	- Grean Orthan, Master Golomancer keeps his home here in this large stone-brick temple. This building is pristine in condition, and it's construction is acultural.
	- Orthan holds control over 4 massive flesh golems, all of whom are clad in chiton platemail and holding fierce weapons.
	- Those creatures who die here will become puddles of living flesh. When the temple itself is in danger, these otherwise unconnected fleshes gather together to defend their home.
	- Creatures who spend a day or more here will become of pristine health.
#### AO14. Cave of Qillark & Vienze
	- Qillark the Blue & Vienze the White are a mating pair of Adult Dragons.
	- They command a cult of mixed blood Kobolds that hunt for food & fealty to the Dragons.
	- The cave is massive, housing both the dragons and their cult underground. The few who know of the cave know to stay away.
#### AP1. World's End Stones
	- A collection of five tall stones are emerging from the sand in this place. Local superstition is that all who pass beyond this marker are doomed to never return.
