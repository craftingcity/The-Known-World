#### AE2. Temple to Hades
	- This place is legendary. It has involvement with [[The Grey Ordeal]] and their exploits in the [[Timeline#The Age of Beginning]] - specifically the [[First Invasion of Orcus]] - though the origins of the temple itself are genuinely unknown.
		- The temple has 3 levels, and is built of red sandstone into the western hills, before beginning to descend into a (now cut-stone) temple intended for mass cult meetings.
		- Markings of many hundred styles and meanings mark the walls of this place - as if teens would come here to hang.
		- Many of the "demonic" or "devilish" statues or reliefs here have been defaced or are missing, but still a pattern of information can be gleamed:
			- The texts here are in Infernal, and all display rythmic ryhming schemes. The content of these texts are generally about prosperity in destruction, the ability to gain power as you take it from others, and the infinite capacity for power that each individual has.
			- Four masked cultists were responsible for rebirthing a bald-headed man by the name or title Kalariel
			- Orcus (or Hades, Jupiter, or Dis Pater, as he may be known) is a big pig-boar-man with a skull-on-a-spine for a wand/staff and is genericaly big and scary. 
		- At the deepest chamber of this temple, locked behind Arcane means (see Stoneshape), a chain of black iron hangs from three of six horn-shaped-outdents carved out of the wall.
		- It is known that [[Tubric Millstone Wrinsmith]] of [[The Grey Ordeal]] died in this place during the raging combat to reach [[Gail Thomas]] as they contacted [[Orcus]].
			- What is unknown - and yet still true - is that [[The Grey Ordeal]] did not ever encounter [[Orcus]], and neither did [[Gail Thomas]]. Kalariel sacrificed Gail and the Grand Four in a ritual that created a Worldbinding to the [[Abyss]], specifically [[Thanatos]]. This explains how Gail's corpse has been recovered by the Guilds.
			- Kalariel excaped into [[Thanatos]], [[Tubric Millstone Wrinsmith]] broke the chain's connection, and [[Waywalket Turring]] bound the area by magic.
	- Currently, a total of 6 Noble Theives from both [[Cobalt]] and [[Agrandica]]'s gangs are combined in force against the native dangers of this place.
		- They are here to investigate recent disappearances in this area, including the most recent [[Ranger's Guild]] teams.
		- They were not prepared for the dangers inside, with information nor equipment.
