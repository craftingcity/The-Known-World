### Scenarios
#### AC2. Nyoser's Gore-House (lair)
#### AD1.
#### AE2. Temple to Hades
	- This place is legendary. It has involvement with [[The Grey Ordeal]] and their exploits in the [[Timeline#The Age of Beginning]] - the [[First Invasion of Orcus]] - though the origins of the temple itself is genuinely unknown.
		- The temple itself has many levels, and is built of red sandstone into the western hills, before beginning to descend into a (now cut-stone) temple intended for mass cult meetings.
		- Many of the "demonic" or "devilish" statues or reliefs here have been defaced or are missing. Markings of many hundred styles and meanings mark the walls of this place.
		- [[Tubric Millstone Wrinsmith]] died in this place during the raging combat to reach [[Gail Thomas]] as they contacted [[Orcus]].
		- Although it has never been activated to completion, at the deepest chamber of this temple, a chain of black iron hangs from three of six horn-shaped-outdents carved out of the wall.
			- (It could perhaps be activated "by some sacrifice"? - I've already established in lore how these chains kinda work.)
	- Currently, a total of 6 Noble Theives from both [[Cobalt]] and [[Agrandica]]'s gangs are combined in force against the native dangers of this place.
		- They are here to investigate recent disappearances in this area, including the most recent [[Ranger's Guild]] teams.
		- They were not prepared for the dangers inside, with information nor equipment.
