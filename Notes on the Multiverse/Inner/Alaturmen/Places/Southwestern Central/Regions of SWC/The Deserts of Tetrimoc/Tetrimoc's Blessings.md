### Scenarios
- AI10. Statue of an Imperialist & a Proletariat (visible)
	- A small four foot bronze statue stands on a platform in the sand. The statue depicts two figures shaking hands; the first is wearing the garb of a Guardsman of the [[Golden Claws]]. The second is wearing a simple pair of shorts and a shirt.
	- On the platform, a plaque reads; "By the words spoken and sancitified in the years of the 33rd and the 34th, the communities of this region have the Blessing of the Great Planeblood Tetrimoc. Every year, on the day of His fall, your please and tithe shall be delivered to him by delegate, and a great festival will be held in his honor."
	- The statue and the plaque are in nearly pristine condition.
	- Two fey-fiddlers and six swarms of wurms dance and engorge around the statue.
