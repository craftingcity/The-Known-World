# Level Five: Pick-up Sticks
## What Dwells Here?
## Exploring this Place
### Navigation
#### Escape Room (Entrance Game)
- The Escape Room pits one team against a timer. The timer lasts three in-game minutes, and a sense of stress should be applied to the players in the form of a real-world timer as well (18-35 minutes).
- The team is collected via their ascent to this level.
- The Goal of the game is to collect a set of three card-tablets (indicated by drawn shadow forms near the timer) that have been scattered throughout the chamber.
	- The Red card is guarded by an obstacle course and an automaton combatant.
	- The Green card is hidden within a grove of plants, specifically within a plant that will deliver a poison upon contact.
	- The Blue card is hidden among a large collection of books within a library. There is not an indication in which book it is hidden, and the destruction of the library is the intended solution for a "quick" solve.
