# Level Five: Pick-up Sticks
Level Five is the first and last level of Kailkeep to offer any sort of ecosystem that promotes cooperation between parties. From the prospective of the participant and the operators, this level continues the game, requiring five tokens per person to progress into the next level - but to the discerning eye, it presents an ecosystem of supply and demand that can be exploited to create a small stable community.

### Navigation
#### Escape Room (Entrance Game)
- The Escape Room pits one team against a timer. The timer lasts three in-game minutes, and a sense of stress should be applied to the players in the form of a real-world timer as well (18-35 minutes).
- The team is collected via their ascent to this level.
- The Goal of the game is to collect a set of three card-tablets (indicated by drawn shadow forms near the timer) that have been scattered throughout the chamber.
	- The Red card is guarded by an obstacle course and an automaton combatant.
	- The Green card is hidden within a grove of plants, specifically within a plant that will deliver a poison upon contact.
	- The Blue card is hidden among a large collection of books within a library. There is not an indication in which book it is hidden, and the destruction of the library is the intended solution for a "quick" solve. 
#### Ways
#### Pick-up Sticks (Exit Game)
- Pick-up Sticks is a level wide game that pits all teams of the level against one another, in theory. 
- The goal of the game is to collect stone tokens dispensed by games throughout the level. When a total of five tokens are inserted by a player, that player is forcibly ascended to the next level - this means that if a party wishes to ascend "together" they must each collect five tokens.
