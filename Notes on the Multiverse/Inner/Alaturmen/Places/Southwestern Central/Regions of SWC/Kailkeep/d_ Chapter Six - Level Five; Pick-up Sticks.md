# Level Five: Pick-up Sticks
Level Five is the first and last level of Kailkeep to offer any sort of ecosystem that promotes cooperation between parties. From the prospective of the participant and the operators, this level continues the game, requiring five tokens per person to progress into the next level - but to the discerning eye, it presents an ecosystem of supply and demand that can be exploited to create a small stable community.

## Exploring this Place
### Navigation
#### Escape Room (Entrance Game)
- The Escape Room pits one team against a timer. The timer lasts three in-game minutes, and a sense of stress should be applied to the players in the form of a real-world timer as well (18-35 minutes).
- The team is collected via their ascent to this level.
- The Goal of the game is to collect a set of three card-tablets (indicated by drawn shadow forms near the timer) that have been scattered throughout the chamber.
	- The Red card is guarded by an obstacle course and an automaton combatant.
	- The Green card is hidden within a grove of plants, specifically within a plant that will deliver a poison upon contact.
	- The Blue card is hidden among a large collection of books within a library. There is not an indication in which book it is hidden, and the destruction of the library is the intended solution for a "quick" solve. 
#### Ways
#### Pick-up Sticks (Exit Game)
- Pick-up Sticks is a level wide game that pits all teams of the level against one another, in theory. 
- The goal of the game is to collect stone **Tokens** dispensed by games throughout the level. When a total of five **Tokens** are inserted by a player, that player is forcibly ascended to the next level - this means that if a party wishes to ascend "together" they must each collect five **Tokens**.
### Detail
#### Go Fish!
- A large salt-water lake hosts a number of aquatic critters, one of which - a quick and small fish - has a **Token**. Other critters will not attack the keyholder, and even larger predators will defend a smaller keyholder.
- The largest threat to a competent combatant is drowning. 
	- A character may hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + their Con Mod, with 30 seconds as a minimum. Convert this number into rounds of initiative (at 6 seconds per round). A character expends a round of held breath on the beginning of their turn.
	- If a character takes a Move Action or a Standard Action, they must spend an additional round (6 seconds) of held breath to do so.
	- After a character runs out of breath, they begin drowning. A character may only be drowning for a number of rounds equal to their Con Mod, with 1 round as a minimum. If they are without air for this many rounds, they are reduced to 0 HP and are dying.
#### Bouncy House
- This chamber contains a system of plate-based launchers that shoot characters high into the air.
- A **Token** is hanging upon a small ledge near the top and center of the chamber.
#### Puppet's Game
- This chamber contains a number of colored mosaic tiles and a large mannequin in a daunting stretched pose.
#### Shooting Gallery
- This long chamber is notably lined with ballista on one side (the end or sides of the hall is preferable) that are being controlled remotely by a number of Kobolds behind their protective stone.
#### Beast Barracks
- This chamber is one of many beast homes within the mountains of Kailkeep. Somehow, this creature is compensated by the Kobolds of Kailkeep.
- The Barracks hold many lower power creatures that made their home here, and they are modestly housed, but are malnourished and conditioned to attack non-Kobolds on detection.
- Blind Dogs, Mindless Guand, Mountain Cats, and even some Madwalkers are common in the Fourth level of Kailkeep.
#### Burning Hallway
- A long hallway reminiscent of the *Dart Halls* from lower floors. This hall is covered in tiles of pressure plates, and the walls are lined with thin ports.
#### Blood for Coin
- A smaller chamber that holds a number of visible tanks on the wall below accompanying **Tokens**. In the center of the chamber, there is a stone bowl with a small grate at the bottom stained a dark red.
- As the stone bowl is filled with blood, it will travel to one of the tanks on the walls. When a tank is filled with 16 pints of blood (2-3 bodies), the tank's **Token** becomes available.
#### Clean Ooze
#### 'Mercy'
##### Pop: 378
- This series of chambers is the one Holding within Kailkeep's Hells. There is a population of some 400 survivors who have permanently made their home here.
- A majority of these people are farmers and crafters. Between residents, barter is generally the preferred method of commerce, trading necessities between each other. They generally trade their surplus to for the things that only trips out of town can provide, relying on the few local & trusted Roamers or Merchants.
	- The following resources are "available to the public";
		- ###### FOOD
			- Vermin & Fish
			- Bluecap Flour
			- Hookstalk
			- Ripplebark
			- Cactus Fruits & Meat
			- Mountain Flowers
			- Lace Mycillium
		- ###### MATERIAL
			- Lithel (Cavern Grass)
			- Metallic Scrap
			- Wooden Scrap
			- Bone
- The few bold enough to continually travel to and from Mercy are known as Roamers, and while they are in some senses revered, they are equally shunned, leading to the need for a middleman; the Merchant.
