# Big City Kobolds
Kailkeep is a massive, mountain wide structure that bases much of its production and gathering in its entertainment; the Hells of Kailkeep.

Running the game may seem a difficult task on its own to some of our newest recruits (Welcome! Please find your cloaks and folder of unplayed characters in your goodie bag on your way out â€“ and please, a round of applause for reading almost the whole fucking book), and that is true - Kailkeep's Hells are a stressor for all at the table - those of us with some level of *deeper understanding of the game* (whatever that means) should be careful to expand and maintain Kailkeep well as a functioning and expanding organism. 

## Examining the Existing Levels of the Hells
### False Allure
#### Level One
- Kobolds of Kailkeep pay these retirees in food and supplies to produce weapons and ammo in exchange for the next payment.
- Partmaking B forges the metals given to them by the Kobolds into the lengths and shapes required for Partmaking A to create the finished parts and for Fine to create their finished parts.
- Primary takes these Partmaking A's products and creates finished weaponry, which go to Examination, and then Export.
- Fine takes the material from Production B and creates jewelry, sending them to Examination and then Export.

### Lower Hells
### Upper Hells
### Kailkeep Proper
- Proper Kailkeep is a system of highway-like tunnels that connect neighborhoods, commercial and industrial districts with the entertainment viewing halls.
- A section close to the peak of the mountain is dedicated to the religious following and appeasal of Terra.
- There are three major neighborhoods in the Lower levels of Kailkeep - Surkain, Hauro, and Grykain - and three major neighborhoods in the Upper levels - Keepaiyn, Suurkail, and Yuub. Each of these locations has many commercial and industrial sections.
