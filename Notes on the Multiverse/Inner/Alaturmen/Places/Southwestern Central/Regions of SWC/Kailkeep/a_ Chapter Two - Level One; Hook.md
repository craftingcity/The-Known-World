# Level One: Hook
The first level of Kailkeep is a series of halls and chambers seemingly built in a brutalist and well crafted - "dwarven" - style. Throughout this level, pockets of the weakest Loyalists dwell in relative safety, but doomed to boredom in an endless cycle of production and relocation.

The purpose of this level is to begin to lull any entrants into a false sense of security. The furniture and decorations support the theory that this was once a [[Mountain Hall]] outpost that spread throughout this lone mountain, only for them to lose control of the outpost to a magically potent Kobold clan.

## What Dwells Here?
### Loyalists
The loyalists in the first level are the weakest of them all - the elders, the children, the limbless. Few could survive a direct confrontation, and fewer could create an advantage to strike intruders against. The plan of action for any loyalists is to disengage and retreat to the nearest *Kobolted Door* to report the incident.

When they are not retreating from intruders, they are harvesting lichen and algae from pools of water, hunting rodents and small insects, and producing simple arms, armors, and textiles with the tools and supplies given to them by their Kobold keepers.

## Exploring this Place
For a few miles, at the bottom of this great hell, a series of chambers continually produce a varied combination of the following types of rooms.

### Entrance Hall
The Entrance Hall is an incredibly long hall of ornate carved stone walls and columns that is egressed by two sets of double doors made of this same thick red stone. 

### Grand Chamber
### Mess Hall
### Workshops
### Servant Quarters
