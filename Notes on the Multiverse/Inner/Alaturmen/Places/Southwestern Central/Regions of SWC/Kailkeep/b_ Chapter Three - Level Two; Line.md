# Level Two: Line
The second level of Kailkeep extends the ruse of the first; continuing in the "dwarven style", with additional artistic pieces that more explicitly tell the story of the imaginary dwarves.

Explicitly, the second level tells the tale (in pictograms and [[Montal (language)]]) of discovering and claiming this place for [[Mountain Hall]], including self-indulgent references to a "powerful kobold clan" that continually presents issues to the dwarves of the story.
