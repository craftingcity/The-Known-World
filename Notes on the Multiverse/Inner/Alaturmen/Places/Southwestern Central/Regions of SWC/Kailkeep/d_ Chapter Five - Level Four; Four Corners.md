# Level Four: Four Corners
The fourth layer of Kailkeep harbors the first major game-as-progression. At points throughout the level, a large square room contains the game; four equal quarters are separated by a waist-high barrier. On two opposing sides, two chambers hold the competing teams, and hanging in the center is a large cage that contains the threat - and the escape. 

Getting to the game is no small task however, but the introduction of the Scoreboard rooms does present a glimmer of hope. The new dangers of the true Hells are common now, and the party's reputation should be coalescing in the collective audience's mind.

### Detail
#### Spear Hall
- A hallway flanked by viewports & spearholes. Either set to manual operation for the joy of the Kobolds or automatic for the operation of unremarkable rooms.
- On occasion, one end of the hall does not continue into the Hells further, forcing an adventurer who once passed the spears to do so again.
- Spears extend once per round. A character who fails on a DC 15 Dex Save takes 2d8 + 1 piecing damage.
