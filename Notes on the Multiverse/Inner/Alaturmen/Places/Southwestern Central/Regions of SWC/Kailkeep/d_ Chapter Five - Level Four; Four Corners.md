# Level Four: Four Corners
The fourth layer of Kailkeep harbors the first major game-as-progression. At points throughout the level, a large square room contains the game; four equal quarters are separated by a waist-high barrier. On two opposing sides, two chambers hold the competing teams, and hanging in the center is a large cage that contains the threat - and the escape. 

Getting to the game is no small task however, but the introduction of the Scoreboard rooms does present a glimmer of hope. The new dangers of the true Hells are common now, and the party's reputation should be coalessing in the collective audience's mind.
