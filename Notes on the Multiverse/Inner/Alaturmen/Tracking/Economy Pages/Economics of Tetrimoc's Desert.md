# Tetrimoc's Desert's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
I'm gonna need at the very least, a size, terrain, and weather pattern.

Tetrimoc's Desert is a lawless and vast desert. Warm during the day, cold during the night â€“ and very dry.

### Corn
The Desert of Tetrimoc is warm during the day and cold during the night. Maize grows well in these conditions, and consumes most of the nutrients in the sandy soil in this region.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
#### Dairy
#### Grain
#### Fruit
Cactus!
#### Vegetable
#### Spice and Oil
Rosemary, Lavender, Oregano,

Olives and Almonds grow on the West bank of the [[Alavini River]].
#### Delicacy

### Vices
What do people do for *fun*?

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

Lead, Silver, and Gold can be found in abundance in this area.

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
