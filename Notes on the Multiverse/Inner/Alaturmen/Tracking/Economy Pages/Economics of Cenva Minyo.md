# The Economy of Cenva Minyo
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
To the South of the [[Actstow Hills]], a thick pine forest is home to poor soil and [[Cenva Minyo]].

### Potato Bread
On the floor of the forest, potatoes are cultivated by the farmers of Cenva Minyo. The soil here is poor, but not infertile, and the potatoes are hardy starch. Potato flour makes a wonderful white bread to boot.

### Food
#### Meat
Game is the most accessible meat to any Cenvan. Small family ranches herd goats and pig. Rarely, Fowl is imported from the north, or Beef from the south.

#### Dairy
Goat is the only true dairy produced in Cenva Minyo. Peanut milk is a cheap but poor substitute imported from the north. Milk Cheese is highly desired, and is imported as often as possible.

#### Grain
Potato is the "grain" of Cenva Minyo; it's flour makes a fluffy white bread that the people of Cenva Minyo treat as a honorable and common delicacy. Rarely, Cenvans gain access to Rye or Peanut flours, but neither is culturally acceptable for humanoid consumption.

#### Fruit
The fruit that grows in this place is bitter. Two fruits, Maupio and Yarpio, are the two most widely cultivated fruits of the area. They are both bitter and dark. Maupio takes the form of a etaerio, multiple sacs of juice and seed, while Yarpio takes the form of a berry, roughly the size and shape of a grap

#### Vegetable
#### Spice and Oil
#### Delicacy

### Vices
What do people do for *fun*?

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

Cenva Minyo exports much of Alaturmen's elvenfiber, second only to the Combine, and it is Cenva Minyo's most acceptable textile.

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
