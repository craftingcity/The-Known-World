# The Economy of Cenva Minyo
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
To the South of the [[Actstow Hills]], a thick pine forest is home to poor soil and [[Cenva Minyo]].

### Potato Bread
On the floor of the forest, potatoes are cultivated by the farmers of Cenva Minyo. The soil here is poor, but not infertile, and the potatoes are hardy starch. Potato flour makes a wonderful white bread to boot.

### Food
#### Meat
Game is the most accessible meat to any Cenvan. Small family ranches herd goats and pig. Rarely, Fowl is imported from the north, or Beef from the south.

#### Dairy
Goat is the only true dairy produced in Cenva Minyo. Peanut milk is a cheap but poor substitute imported from the north. Milk Cheese is highly desired, and is imported as often as possible.

#### Grain
Potato is the "grain" of Cenva Minyo; it's flour makes a fluffy white bread that the people of Cenva Minyo treat as a honorable and common delicacy. Rarely, Cenvans gain access to Rye or Peanut flours, but neither is culturally acceptable for humanoid consumption.

#### Fruit
Two fruits, Maupio and Yarpio, are the two most widely cultivated fruits of the area. They are both bitter and dark. Maupio takes the form of a etaerio, multiple sacs of juice and seed, while Yarpio takes the form of a berry, roughly the size and shape of a grape. 

Both these fruits grow on a spikey moss-vine hybrid that, after years of growing, flowering, and repeating, will eventually supplant the roots of it's host and completely take over it's form. After the host body is no longer suitable, the body and the fruit will die - but not before spreading it's seeded fruits as far as it can to begin the process again.

#### Vegetable
Gardens of Lettuce, Cabbage, Radishes, and Carrots add material and textural variety as well as necessary nutrients to a Cenvan's diet. Squahes and Pumpkin grow well, but are not considered a culturally acceptable food.

#### Spice and Oil
Root spices, such as Ginger, Onion, and Garlic, as well as Parsley are cultivated in these "spice of life" gardens. Beet Sugar and Rock Salt are imported from the north too, both of which are used as preservative and flavoring.

Goat's butter is the "oil" of choice for most Cenvans. The dreaded Peanut Oil makes for a cheap but poor replacement, but whenever possible, a "true" Oil imported from the City in Gold and used instead.

#### Delicacy
Beef and Cow's dairy are highly prized, and so too are good oils from the south. When baked with a Pio paste and chopped carrots and radishes, a the products of Cattle or Goat make a dish liable to cause mutiny in your taste buds.

### Vices
Culturally, it is unacceptable to be less than fully lucid - ever watching for our enemy the White Flame, but this does not mean there is not a large market for Vice in Cenva Minyo;

Smokebulb, it's daughter - Bulbkiss, Cannabis, Tabaco, Alcohol, Lephora Essance, Dareanamon, Nova, Sex, and any number of fetishes are available for bargain if you know who and where to ask.

### Land
While there is no *official* civil structure of Cenva Minyo, a council of elders holds a massive force of power, so much so that if they *were* to assign lands, they could. 

As of now, there is no manner other than "conquer and hold" land of your own, and even then, your neighbor needs as you do, and it is your duty as living kin to provide. 

### Overhead
The lack of a civil structure further lacks a formalized tax structure, but the culture of Cenva Minyo promotes community service and kinship so much so that this lack of tax structure does not lead to privatized wealth.

Where other cultures use powerful people or animals, Cenvans once again subvert the norm and rely on their alliances; Cenvan farms and construction use Artifice to perform these necessary super-humanoid feats. Often, this is of Dwarven in heritage, but Elven Artifice is equally present & productive.

Cenvans live above the floor of the forest, preferring to farm the soils below, and live in the branches above. These form collections of well hidden hanging buildings connected by all manner of stair, bridge, rope, and otherwise. When necessary, large production buildings are built on the surface and hidden in thickets of barbed bushes.

### Cutting Corners
If possible, Cenvans in need are supported by their kin. If not, it is an honor to take leave of the homelands and fight against the Fates or the Fire in attempts to survive without your kin. It is a rarity to see a disparity of wealth between Cenvans - it would be culturally unacceptable, near *criminal*, for the wealthier not support the poorer.

The luxuries of Cenva Minyo are small and meaningful, or culturally unacceptable for being meaningless. Privacy is desired, and thankfully, commonly available - with it, comes the desire for Community, which thankfully too is common.

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

What little trade does happen between Cenva Minyo and another faction is exclusively a mutually beneficial relationship - whats the long term, why us, why you, how, etc. Between Cenvan themselves, "trade" is cuturally necessary.

Those folk who craft specialty items share their knowledge freely to all who wish to learn and can prove themselves worthy to hold the power that the knowledge they keep wields.

"Markets" are much more festivals or deliveries. Both involve the Cenvans of most ill-repute, honestly mostly as a time to enjoy themselves without the pressure of their society.

### Craftsmen
> Those folk who craft specialty items share their knowledge freely to all who wish to learn and can prove themselves worthy to hold the power that the knowledge they keep wields.

Each crafter keeps their own requirements for apprenticeship. They are an honored class, who are granted their secrets in exchange for their products.

### Textiles
Cenva Minyo exports much of Alaturmen's elvenfiber, second only to the Combine, and it is Cenva Minyo's most acceptable textile. Leather and fur are also acceptable, but non-elvenfiber plant material textiles are unacceptable. Cenvans rarely dye their clothing, much rather preferring to wear the greens and browns that keep them well hidden within their forests, but those dyes that are used are typically imported from the south or east.

### Preservation
Bread, Vegtables, Fruit, and Meat all can be preserved by elvenfiber by a simple, but complete, wrap. Typically, this is all that is necessary to preserve, but pickled vegetables, fruit preserve, and jerkied or dried meat are also made. In some cases, magically frigid or even frozen rooms or cases keep fresh foods. 

Winter is a harsh season for Cenvans, and many cities must resort to sending some of it's members to return another time. Some do. Some do not.

### Containers
When containing large quantities of edibles or other goods, wood is the prefered storage material; be it barrels crates, chests, etc. Typically, Cenvans prefer the natural re-usable container.

### Mining
Due to the long term alliance Cenva Minyo has with the [[Dwarven Kingdom Actstow]], all the metals used in Cenva Minyo come from the Hills to the north.

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
