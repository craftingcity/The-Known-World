# The Democratic Combine of People's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
While each state of Combines varies in their favors and productions, this page paints the broad strokes of the Combine's economy.

Combine is a warm and wet place, magically infused with ancient elven and druidic magics.

### Rice
Rice! Gods bless Rice! On its own, sauced, in risotto, sushi, pudding, so many dishes!

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Fish is the most common meat in the combine. Crab, Shellfish, and Turtle are uncommon, but still accessible. Many people cultivate farms of bugs for many reasons, including as food, bait, spice, and dye.

Folks husband Goats and Pig in the wetlands of Combines, as well fowl such as Ducks and Geese. Some very power people husband cattle as well, but this is a difficult and expensive task here.

#### Dairy
Goats are prized possessions for the families of Combine, and the same is true of Cattle and the lords. While both true dairies and alternatives - such as walnut or almond - are available, Cow's milk is most desired, and alternatives to Goat are less desirable and expensive.

#### Grain
Rice is *the* grain of the Combines. No other grain is really desired or grown here, except perhaps for the sake of variety in luxury.

Fine white flour is imported for certain delicacies, but most folk enjoy the taste of their home-grown grain.

#### Fruit
Citrus, Plum, Peach, Pear, Cherries, Tomatoes, Papaya, Mango, and many other warm growing fruits are prosperous in this area. These myriad of fruits are dried, salted, and preserved throughout the Combine.

#### Vegetable
Skunk Weed, Water Spinach, Water Caltrop, Taro, Lotus, Cattail are few of the many Stinky, Leafy, Starchy vegetables that grow in the Combine. Vegetable soups are a common and *acquired* taste, especially when spiced poorly.

Summer Squashes do well in the heat of Combine.

Marigold and Catnip are worth mentioning as they do appear in most gardens in the Combine, but not as a consumable or a spice, but rather a repellent and an attractant. Wild cats are culturally considered good luck, and well tended ones may even provide minor gifts or service.

Animals are fed with rinds from melons and squashes, or with peas or poor spinach.

#### Spice and Oil
Jasmine, Water-Pepper, Wasabi, Basil, and Sage all grow well in the warmer wetter conditions of Combine. 

Lemongrass often appears as a garnish and a tea in the Combine.

Olive and Almond oils are imported from the West bank of the [[Alvalini River]] for relatively cheap, and most middle class families could access them for their everyday meals.

Poorer oils such as Heart-nut are imported from the north, but the common folk have little choice but goat butter or lard for their oil.

#### Delicacy
Sweet rice cake are a wonderful treat, but the best dish an upper-middle class family could ask for is sweet-and-sour beef with vegetable, noodle, and rice.

Nobles import white flour for some pastries and other fine dishes, but these are reserved for occasion to all but the richest of citizens.

### Vices
Some of the best alcohols known to Alaturmen come from the Combine's distilleries, and many fall to the vice Lush in this fertile land. From the north, Smokebulb, Cannabis, and Tobacco are imported in droves to Combine.

As with all Alaturmen, the brothels here are under the protection of the [[Guild of Merchants#Yáramólë]].

### Land
Ownership of domain in the Combine is reserved for those who can back their claim by power. One resides on the domain of one's Baron, who one swears a fealty to for as long as they may reside in their domain - at least, they say they do.

Most land is very wet and fertile in Combine, and can support much plant growth if properly cultivated.

### Overhead
A Baron will tax one day of the month from each individual, and one day of the week from each business. This is nearly universal between individual Barons, a measure of uniformity to this anarchic place.

Many citizens of Combine are quite strong, and their labor is highly valued in farms and transportation companies. Many people hire Goliath or Bugbear to do the labor that a typical work animal would perform.

All of the buildings in this area are reinforced against water damage and many are on stilts above the waterlines. Boardwalks and bridges make inter-building travel easy. All builds of production have heavy roofs.

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

A Baron is rarely without work, and often without help. When necessary, one could reach an agreement with a Baron for extended lodging, feeding, or otherwise, in exchange for some service provided during this time. While this is not favorable, it is common, especially for those who have no "true" home, and dwell in-between lands.

The Peoples of Combine value metal above nearly all else. It is a near-rarity here, due to high demand and low supply. Good meat and milk make wonderful dishes, but a fine sword gets me and mine to next week.

### Middlemen
Many merchant companies rely on their ability to be mobile, following the demand of their supply as the needs and politics of the Baronies change. These bands often perform trade during travel, but gather in larger markets alongside more permanent stalls or stores. 

The [[Guilds of Coalition]] are powerful in the Combine. One may imagine that the turmoil of this anarchic place would lead these secret-based job securities to become exposed, spread, and devalued, and yet this is not the case. Agents of the Guilds of Merchants and Adventurers create a kind of network of power below their Barons, and use their power to keep the interests of the [[Guilds of Coalition]] strong in Combine.

### Craftsmen
The [[Guild of Crafters]] relies heavily on this underlying network to maintain their secrets and value, although their power declines quickly in correlation to the density of population. Few specialists find work outside of cities.

### Textiles
The Peoples of Combine wear leathers or linens. Furs are much too warm, and hempen clothing is considered socially unacceptable, even for the poorest citizens. The people of means have taken to wearing armor of near-comfortably plated chitin or scales below their public facing garb.

The fruits and bugs of the region make most colors of dye accessible to people in this region, and the availability of pure-alpha dye from the west leads to almost every dye being possible, if not accessible.

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

Meat is typically smoked or dried into pemmican. Cheese is a preserved delicacy here. Fruits are often dried on their own, or into pemmican, or preserved into a jelly, jam, or spirit. Vegetables are typically preserved in fruit vinegars, and while these flavors are quite vibrant and novel, they are not typically considered "tasty".

### Containers
Most people in the combine use bags of hemp and leather to store loose goods, and stow items in wooden boxes or chests when they are not in use. Dark glasses are the most preferable container for liquids – clear glass is a sign of wealth or companionship – or ceramics, if glass is inaccessible or an improper material.

The Peoples of Combine are typically reserved to display what they may or may not have, as one can never be too sure that an enemy isn't about. This paranoia incidentally leads to the use of opaque, reusable containers.

### Mining
Copper and Tin can be mined in some large amounts in the area of the Combine, but what little other metal ores are present require specialized processing to separate from "nature", such as bog iron and by-product gold. 

There is little interest in purely-Combine produced metals, as imports are typically considered superior, as well as being usually very nearly equal in price.

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?

This area has an unnatural fertility, plants grow very fruitfully here even when improperly tended. Some larger villages and most cities have access to waterways that power all the automation that the people can build, including mills, plumbing, and in rare cases even forms of public transportation. Often smaller villages or large villages without a waterway rely on large wind turbines for their mills and do not have those above benefits.
