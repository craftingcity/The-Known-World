# The Democratic Combine of People's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
While each state of Combines varies in their favors and productions, this page paints the broad strokes of the Combine's economy.

Combine is a warm and wet place, magically infused with ancient elven and druidic magics.

### Rice
Rice! Gods bless Rice! On its own, sauced, in risotto, sushi, pudding, so many dishes!

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Fish is the most common meat in the combine. Crab and Shellfish are uncommon, but still accessible. Many people cultivate farms of bugs for many reasons, including as food, bait, spice, and dye.

Folks husband Goats and Pig in the wetlands of Combines, as well fowl such as Ducks and Geese.

Some very important people husband cattle as well, but because of the anarchic nature of the Combines, grazing is an issue.

#### Dairy
Goats are prized possessions for the families of Combine, and the same is true of Cattle and the lords. While both true dairies and alternatives - such as walnut or imported almond - are available Cow's milk is most desired, and alternatives to Goat are less desirable and expensive.

#### Grain
Rice is *the* grain of the Combines. No other grain is really desired or grown here, except perhaps for the sake of variety.

Fine white flour is imported for certain delicacies, but most folk enjoy the taste of their home-grown grain.

#### Fruit

#### Vegetable
Skunk Weed, Water SPinach
#### Spice and Oil
Jasmine, Water-Pepper

#### Delicacy
Sweet rice cake are a wonderful treat, but the top delicacy is sweet-and-sour beef.

### Vices
Some of the best alcohols known to Alaturmen come from the Combine's distilleries, and many fall to the vice Lush in this fertile land.

As with all Alaturmen, the brothels here are under the protection of the [[Guild of Merchants#Yáramólë]].

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
