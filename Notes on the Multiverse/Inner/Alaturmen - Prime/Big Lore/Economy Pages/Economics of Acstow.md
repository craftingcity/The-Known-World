# Acstow's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
I'm gonna need at the very least, a size, terrain, and weather pattern.

The soil of [[Actstow Hills]] is extremely poor. The large majority of the supply of food in Actstow is grown underground, meaning that the pattern of weather is of no concern and heat can be controlled well.

### Potato Bread
Potatoes grow well in the conditions of Acstow's greenhouses, and grow plentifully at that. Potato flour makes a wonderful white bread to boot.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Foul make up the large majority of an Acstownian's meat supplies. Chevron takes a far second. No game is available in Acstow, as it is neither produced nor imported here.

#### Dairy
Goat is the only available true dairy in Acstow. Peanut and Almond milks are acceptable substitutes in most cases.

#### Grain
Largely, potato is the only "grain" produced in Acstow. Small amounts of other grains could be found, but not in large quantities, and almost certainly not for sale.

#### Fruit


#### Vegetable
#### Spice and Oil
#### Delicacy

### Vices
What do people do for *fun*?

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
