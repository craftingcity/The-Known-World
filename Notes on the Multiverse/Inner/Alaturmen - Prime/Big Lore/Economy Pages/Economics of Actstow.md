# Actstow's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The soil of [[Actstow Hills]] is extremely poor. The large majority of the supply of food in Actstow is grown underground, meaning that the pattern of weather is of no concern and heat can be controlled well, leaving space as the main concern for farmers.

### Potato Bread
Potatoes grow well in the conditions of Acstow's greenhouses, and grow plentifully at that. Potato flour makes a wonderful white bread to boot.

### Food
#### Meat
Foul make up the large majority of an Acstownian's meat supplies. Chevron takes a far second. No game is available in Actstow, as it is neither produced nor imported here.

#### Dairy
Goat is the only available true dairy in Actstow. Peanut and Almond milks are acceptable substitutes in most cases.

#### Grain
Potatoes and Peanuts are the two most common flours in Actstow. Potato flour makes a fluffy white bread while Peanut makes a dense protein heavy soup thickener or breading.

Small amounts of true grains could be found, but not in large quantities, and almost certainly not for sale.

#### Fruit
While soil and temperature can be controlled, space is an issue for growing Fruit in Actstow. Those fruits that are grown here are grown in low quantity and quality do to this restriction. Those fruit that are grown are rarely eaten on their own, more commonly becoming preservative or drink. 

Actstow grows Peach and Plum for their plump juices and Peanuts for their protein. Lemon, Lime, and Orange are cultivated here because of their rarely elsewhere in the world, but they are poor in quality compared to world imports. "Emerging" Avocados grow better than most in Acstow's conditions, leading them to be a higher quantity fruit in Actstow.

#### Vegetable
Roots – such as Carrots, Turnips, Radishes – and Tubers – such as Potatoes, Yams, Taro – grow well in the limited space of Actstow. Dense leafy greens like Cabbage and Lettuce grow well too.

#### Spice and Oil
Beet Sugar and Salt are the two most common spices and preservatives in Actstow. Avocado and Peanuts make fine oils when processed by the hill dwarves' enhanced methods. 

Garlic, Ginger, and Onion grow well in the limiting conditions. Mint and Parsley are commonly imported from the east. Cinnamon is more uncommon, but still accessible to the lower-middle class, also imported from the east.

#### Delicacy
Goat-butter fried peanut-breaded-chicken (or beef if you can get it imported) is a *wonderful* Actstow dish. Pairs well with ginger, onion, and garlic.

A local delicacy of the children of Actstow is a frozen dairy cream, sweetened with spices such as cinnamon, ginger, and fruit.

Actstow is a fairly rich place, although not well positioned for massive trade, meaning most delicacy is imported or outlawed.

### Vices
The home-grown vices of Actstow are Smokebulb, Tobacco, and Cannabis. Smokebulb is culturally unacceptable, but fine Cannabis and Tobacco are imported from elsewhere and are much more culturally acceptable.

Some brothels crop up in Actstow, but these, like Smokebulb, are considered culturally unacceptable and are generally run *poorly*, refusing assistance from the [[Guild of Merchants]].

### Land
Land in Actstow is a prime resource. One can purchase or lease land from the King or the ruling Clan in units of 1/8th acres. Rooms in Inns and the like are costly.

### Overhead
Taxes are payed by the Clans. Clans have individual tax regimes, using different methods to calculate the correct figures, but most commoners end up paying about one-fifth of their profit to their Clan. The Clans then each turn and pay the King, about one-sixth of *their* profit. These tax collections happen every ten years, and are enforced by mundane tax collectors that quote figures based on what they can observe. Most folks attempt to cheat the collectors, leading to the low figures seen above. This crime is considered minor and is punished by fine, leading to someone who gets caught paying closer to one-third of their profit from this ten year period.

All mines are owned by the King of Actstow. These veins of fortune are taxed heavily, and miners take home only as much as 1/2 or even 1/3 of what they mined after management takes its due. 

### Cutting Corners
Recovering from loss is difficult in Actstow. If one does not produce enough food or ore or gem or smith'd, one does not have many manners of recovery other than those they develop for themselves, i.e. crime. 

The most common of these methods is tax evasion. Most citizens of Actstow keep a hidden compartment or room for their most valued possessions, including (when the tax collector comes) work-stations, tools, fine furniture and clothing, and food preserves.

Soups and Stews are considered a poor meal. Many commoners must make these "watered down dishes" to stretch their food supplies and for ease of transport; scooping a day's breakfast and lunch on your way out the door to the mines is not uncommon in poorer families of Acstow.

### Middlemen
Trade is heavily influenced by the value of what is mined and what is needed by the current goals of the Clans. Unions of Miners raise the price of "private" minerals such that they can afford to continue to do their work. Much of these "private" minerals are exported to other entities by caravans that trade in such things.

Collections of stair-climbing market stalls appear wherever people gather. Markets such as these have all manner of goods, although it is common to find many things missing from the available selection as merchants move to different markets throughout the day.

### Craftsmen
Most production companies in Actstow are teams of at least two members, one to acquire material, the other to work it. Commonly, a third member exports the crafts, but if this is not an option, freelance merchants buy in bulk all around Actstow.

Because this "family" style operation is so common in Actstow, specialists have an easier time hiding their secrets from spies and competitors.

Actstow does mint its own coins, but Prosper's coins are accepted for their full value here.

### Textiles
Linen and Fine Leathers are the only truly acceptable clothing materials in Actstow. Feathers are a common filigree.

Hemp is a poor dwarves' material, more used for containing than wearing. 

Farms of domesticated Wurm make many colors dye, but the Pure Whites and Blacks are extremely rare in Actstow.

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

Actstow's climate is controlled, and magically maintained iceboxes are accessible to the upper middle class. Salted meats and Canned fruits and vegetables are extremely common in Actstow to those that cannot afford to keep ice.

### Containers
Many containers are metal or glass, and re-usability is a prime directive when crafting containers.

The people of Actstow generally use metal, preferring to keep their secrets.

Wooden and Ceramic containers are acceptable, cheaper alternatives to the finer metallic dishes.

### Mining
Anything and everything can be mined in the [[Actstow Hills]], but many things are rarer than others. Durandurm is extremely rare even compared to other gem rarities.

Much of the hills in this place are dense in ore and mineral. The separation of portions or purity level of what is mined may require chemical or even alchemical separation, which can be an expensive, although rarely lengthy, task before it can be processed for creation.

### Magic / Technology
Oh, ho-ho! Let me tell you about the magic of the Dwarven Kingdom of Actstow. The pots that the farmers grow their foods in are enchanted by their creators. The tools are too, as are the rooms – climate control, remember – and many of the complex mechanisms that move the dwarves and supplies around the Hills.

Speaking of those mechanisms, systems of elevators, large pneumatic delivery systems, minor automatons of gear and gem. The poor of Actstow are very poor, but a large middle class lives a comfortable life under the rule of the Clans serving the King.
