# Territories of the Northeastern Hobgoblin Clans' Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The area of the Hobgoblin Territories is largely forested. It is cold and rainy in this area. 

### "Bread"
Pemmican is a combination of powdered meat, fruit, and boiled fat. It lasts a long time, is cheap, and quite dense in nutrition.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
The most common meat is game by a large degree. Rat and Deer are the most common of the common. Cattle is hard to manage in the denser parts of the forest, so Goats are a much more common farm animal. Goose and Duck are commonly kept as well, for their feathers, eggs, and meat.

#### Dairy
Goats milk and cheese are reasonably common, as are Goose and Duck egg. Some folks press nuts into dairy products as well, but this is a time consuming process that produces a less desirable product.

#### Grain
Wheat does not grow wild here, although Barley does. Acorns and Heartnut are reasonable replacements in breads, but Rye is preferable.

#### Fruit
Apple, Pear, and Berries grow in abundance in the dense forests of the area. Sweet and Hard drinks made from these fruits are the preferred drinks of the area, although Beer is produced as well.

#### Vegetable
Lettuces, Cabbage, Carrots, Potatoes grow well in the shade of the dense forests. Animals feed on grass and wild insects as well as grown vegetables as well.

#### Spice and Oil
Mint and Parsley grow well in the shade, as well as the common roots such as Garlic and Onion.

Beets grow wild in the deeper parts of the forest, and are almost always used as a sweetener either as whole or in sugar. Honey is as rare as beets, and just as about as hard to correctly harvest for its sweet juice.

Nut oils and milks are made, but considered poor replacements for goat's butter. Rarely, "true" Oils from the City in Gold make their way into the territories and are highly valued.

#### Delicacy
Beef and Cow's dairy are highly prized, along with White flour products. Good oils and spices are hard to come by in this area.

### Vices
The Clans of the Territories gather for Festivals and Gladiatorial Combat when at peace. The hard drinks of fruit are prized in this area, beer less, but acceptably so. Some of the forage of the area is psychedelicly active, and highly prized for this effect.

### Land
The Clans of the Territories fight eachother for their land. If they can take land by force, a Mangugu would attempt to do so, for the prosperity of their clan. 

### Overhead
Because there is no greater collective of the Clans, other than the [[Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact]], taxes are always in the form of community service to the local Mangugu. Most folks live in these semi-nomadic clans, but well established clans often have more permanent structures if they believe that they can be defended. Production processes, if they can be permanent and defended, can be large, but otherwise, are generally small and personal.

### Cutting Corners
When times are very tough, the people of the Territories know that they are not above eating the meat of their own fallen. Neither Humanoid or Goblinoid is an *acceptable* meat, but when there is no other alternative for you, your Clan, your Clan's goats, the people you just felled for their farmland are still fresh meat. Generally, this is unnecessary, the forests provide.

Butter is a necessity of life in the Territories, most people make it on their own, during travel. If survival is key, forgoing even the simplest spices of onion and mint would stretch a Clan's budget.

### Middlemen
Trade between peaced Clans are common enough to consider their economy together as we do, and most "merchants" work directly under their Mangugu to maintain certainty of inventory. Festival markets are quickly mobilized, in constant preparation for an assault. 

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
