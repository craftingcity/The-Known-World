# What is alchemy?
Alchemy is the process of creating or imparting a consistent magical effect into or onto a material substance.

Often, the finished results are the potions that keep adventurers alive, the tinctures that commoners take to stave off disease, and the trinkets and items that perform specific tasks all around Alaturmen.

Experts and Masters of the craft of Alchemy are likely working with ingredients and products not on upcoming listings – items so rare that they cannot be mentioned, or secret procedures producing higher quality items.

# How do I start?

Very little learned magic can be enough to start an alchemist on their journey. Mending, Presdedigation, and like cantrips are very useful tools in any alchemist's tool-belt.

Alchemy begins at the Philosopher's stone. A Philosipher's Stone or some of its baser products are a requirement in higher level alchemy. Creating such a stone requires a spark of life, a powder of wisdom, and time. Such vague ingredients have led many alchemists to form their own recipes for creating such a work.

Once an alchemist has their stone, they can create Red Water, and Yellow Powder, two forms of material that inherit portions of the abilities of the Philosophers Stone. Recipes for creating Philosopher's Stones that bear these ingredients form new Stones much quicker than those without.
