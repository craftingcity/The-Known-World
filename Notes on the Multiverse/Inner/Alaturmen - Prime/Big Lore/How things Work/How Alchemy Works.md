# What is alchemy?
Alchemy is the process of creating or imparting a consistent magical effect into or onto a material substance.

Often, the finished results are the potions that keep adventurers alive, the tinctures that commoners take to stave off disease, and the trinkets and items that perform specific tasks all around Alaturmen.

Experts and Masters of the craft of Alchemy are likely working with ingredients and products not on upcoming listings – items so rare that they cannot be mentioned, or secret procedures producing higher quality items.

# How do I start?
You will need tools to set up your lab. Most alchemists have their own recipes, containers, processes and the like. No magic is necessary to begin alchemy, but it certainly can make the processes much easier or otherwise replace some steps of a recipe.

## Philosopher's Stone
Alchemy almost always begins at the Philosopher's stone. A Philosipher's Stone or some of its baser products are a requirement in higher level alchemy. 

Creating such a stone requires "a spark of life", "a powder of wisdom", and time. The vaguer ingredients have led many alchemists to form their own recipes for creating such a work.

Expert Alchemists can create Red Water, and Journeymen can craft Yellow Powder. These two materials are the two forms of Philosopher's Stone. Recipes for creating Philosopher's Stones that bear these ingredients form new Stones much quicker than those without, leading to theoretically exponentially increasing production.

# Common Knowledge Ingredients
General Categories list specific categories list rare ingredients in those categories. Rarer ingredients are more potent.

Mechanically, this should simply look like better rolls = better success.

# Common Alchemical Products
All products have either a quality or a required "mastery" of the skills of alchemy – these follow the [[#Grades]] scale.
## Liquids
### Potions
#### Potion of "Healing"
True Potions of healing are expensive, as their components are typically quite rare. A potion of Apprentice Quality heals for 2d4 + 4 when Quaffed. As the Grade of the created potion increases, so too does the effect, at a doubling rate.

##### Vitality
Passed off as "healing" potions, Potions of Vitality are typically much cheaper than their true cousins, as they do not actually heal any wounds, but rather invigorate the Quaffer for the same number in temperary HP as they would when Quaffing a Potion of Healing.

##### Cure
Potions of "Cure Disease" are a combination of alchemical and traditional anti-biotics, anti-fungals, and anti-parasites.

#### Potion of Resistance
Potions of Resistance provide resistance to non-magical forms of slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage.

##### Elemental Resistance
Potions of Elemental Resistance provide resistance to the corresponding element.

##### Barkskin / Stoneskin
Potions of Barkskin and Potions of Stoneskin are weaker forms of the Potions of Resistance, and effectively cast the spells *barkskin* and *stoneskin* respectively.

#### Potion of Charm
##### Rage
##### Love
##### Greed

#### Potion of Enhance

#### Potion of Detection / Sense / Understanding
##### Detection
##### Sense
##### Understanding

#### Potion of Haste

#### Potion of Dragon's Breath

#### Potion of Form
##### Shadow
##### Gas
##### Aqua
##### Freedom

### Oils
#### Hell Oil
Hell Oil sticks to metal, sliding around and off other materials like water, and burns while in contact with oxygen.

#### Ice Oil
Ice Oil sticks to metal, sliding around and off other materials like water, and freezes while in contact with oxygen.

#### Liquid Light

#### Liquid Fear

#### Liquid Joy

#### Liquid Calm

#### Miner's Savior

### Poisons
#### Sleep Juice

#### Impairment
##### Diminish Affect
##### Blind / Deafen
##### Slow
##### Paralyze

#### King's Last Drink
##### Truth
##### Madness

#### Stink

### Acids
#### Royal Water
This is one of the most powerful Acids an Alchemist can create. This is one of the few substances that would burn through alchemically enhanced solids.

#### Enchanter's Acid
Enchanter's Acid is also a very powerful acid, but only when in the presence of a Woven material, including Runes or Enchanted Objects.

## Gels
#### Dwarven / Gnomish Grease
This grease degrades very slowly, even under great stress, allowing for great works of engineering. As it is quite sticky, one must be very careful during the application process.

#### Scar Balm
A weak healing balm that removes scarring from skin when applied.

#### Heamox Balm
A powerful healing balm that, when correctly applied to wounds, heals both the external and internal wounds of the appliee. This includes, but is not limited to, Bleeding, Poison, Paralysis, and most Diseases.

#### Zombaren Balm
A healing balm that prevents when correctly applied to wounds, fights against the permanent affects of being bitten by a Zombie, including Grave Rot, Pain, Stat Decrease, and Zombification.

#### Huumpo
This pink gel is extremely flammable, and alights on its own when exposed to oxygen.

## Solids
#### Alchemical Clay
Alchemical clay acts like normal clay in nearly every way, except that it is inert to nearly all magical or physical effects. While pieces formed of Alchemical Clay cannot shatter, chip, rust, or otherwise decay, they do dent well when exposed to mild force and an un-moving object. 

> All recipes of alchemical clay require a base of Philosipher's Stone and some inert clay. Other ingredients, and all processes are specific to their recipes.

#### Alchemical Leather / Hide


#### Black Steel
Black Steel is a steel formed alchemically that absorbs light and enhances the malleability of the Weave near it. While this makes forging something of the material even easier than steel, the same can be said of spellcasting while such an item is nearby.

#### Bituitem
A powerful coal-like substance. When used to mark an object, the mark would remain for many hundreds of years. When used as a fuel, the substance burns for multiple years at the same heat as coal of the same size.

Can be used as candles or markers when correctly shaped.
##### Magical Bituitem
Bituitem combined with Yellow Powder and reformed into markers allow for long-lasting rune writings.

#### Pressigen
An alchemical fabric that acts similar to elastic. In addition to its stretching capabilities, it also conforms to an edge on its own; when used to create clothes or when acting as a sealant, the Pressigen squeezes to become water-tight against the object(s).

#### Magical Bean
Traditionally, Magical Beans are used to store Weave Potentia, but they are valued as tokens of friendship between Alchemists and also provide novel although potentially dangerous entertainment when planted.

## Powders
#### Alchemical / Magical Chalk
#### Alchemical Thermite

# Common Enchanter's Products
## Runes
Runes can be written in Magical Chalk or Magical Bituitem to invoke specific effects during ritual, but must become a part of the item they are affecting if the enchanter intends their effect to be permanent. Any "enchanted" item is created by applying runes to some portion of the item.

### Invoke Wonder
#### Alchemical Conjuration
This rune is commonly applied to containers (*alchemy jug*).
#### Animation
This rune provides inert objects the ability to move in simple or complex manners. (*animated shield*).
### Enhance
#### Physical Patches
Patches of Weave applied to armor, ammunition, and weaponry can provide a boost in physical attributes (*amulet of health*).
#### Mental Patches
Patches of Weave applied to armor, ammunition, and weaponry can provide a boost in mental attributes (*amulet of health*).
#### Woven Patches
Patches of Weave applied to armor, ammunition, and weaponry can provide a boost in efficiency (*+1, +2, +3, of slaying,*). 
### Curse
## Scrolls
When an enchanter is attempting to capture the effect of a specific spell, they will create a scroll.
