# Known Alchemical Products
All products have either a quality or a required "mastery" of the skills of alchemy â€“ these follow the [[#Grades]] scale. Time of production varies with Grade as well.

## Liquids
### Non-Potion, Non-Oil Liquids
#### "Biblical" / Elven Wine
Wine processed by some alchemical process that hydrates like water and inebriates like wine.

#### Liquid Light
Liquid light is as it sounds, a liquid form that emits bright light. While not *actually* light made liquid, it performs all the tasks that you could ask from a liquid version of light.

Some adventurers purchase Liquid light and use it as some kind of blinding flash attack or for extremely controlled but powerful light management.

See *light*

#### Liquid Fear
Liquid Fear invokes its namesake in those that nearby. When consumed, if one is bold enough to do such a thing, Liquid Fear is deadly.

See *fear, dissident whispers*

#### Liquid Joy
Liquid Joy provides the opposite effects of Liquid Fear, invoking its namesake in those nearby. When consumed, the feeling is amplified. As one could imagine, this substance is quite addictive.

See *charm person, enthrall*

#### Liquid Calm
Liquid Calm is a soldier's best friend. While it does not combat the physical affects of adrenaline, it does affect the mental ones, allowing oneself to remain calm under even the most extreme pressure.

See *calm emotions*

### Potions
#### Potion of Healing
True Potions of healing are expensive, as their components are typically quite rare. A potion of Apprentice Quality heals for 2d4 + 4 when consumed. As the Grade of the created potion increases, so too does the effect, at a doubling rate.
##### Vitality
Passed off as "healing" potions, Potions of Vitality are typically much cheaper than their true cousins, as they do not actually heal any wounds, but rather invigorate the consumer for the same number in temperary HP as they would when consuming a Potion of Healing.
##### Cure
Potions of "Cure Disease" are a combination of alchemical and traditional anti-biotics, anti-fungals, and anti-parasites.

#### Potion of Resistance
Potions of Resistance provide resistance to non-magical forms of slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage.
##### Elemental Resistance
Potions of Elemental Resistance provide resistance to the corresponding element.
##### Barkskin / Stoneskin
Potions of Barkskin and Potions of Stoneskin are weaker forms of the Potions of Resistance, and effectively cast the spells *barkskin* and *stoneskin* respectively.

#### Potion of Charm
Potions of Charm affect the consumer's disposition.
##### Rage
See *rage, curse of the berserker*
##### Love
See *pilpher of love*

### Oils

Hell Oil sticks to metal, sliding around and off other materials like water, and burns while in contact with oxygen.

See *heat metal*

#### Ice Oil
Ice Oil sticks to metal, sliding around and off other materials like water, and freezes while in contact with oxygen.

See *heat metal*, but imagine its Ice.

#### Miner's Savior
When exposed to oxygen, Miner's Savior expands to form triangles of stone. Its most common use-case gave this substance its name and many miners the opportunity to see their children grow.

See *stoneshape?*

#### Assassin's Slick
When exposed to oxygen, Assassin's Slick creates a thick black fog that lasts for a long time in the air, although it loses it's fight against heavy wind or rain.

See *darkness*

### Poisons
#### Traditional
Traditional poisons act as you would expect, somehow harming or outright killing their consumer.

See the damage table on your DM's screen.

#### Impairment
Many poisons produce effects other than simply killing their consumer.
##### Diminish Affect
Some reduce the attributes of their consumers.
See *enhance ability* and reverse it
##### Blind / Deafen
Or otherwise impair their senses.
See *blind/deafen*
##### Slow
Some reduce a target's ability to move.
See *slow*
##### Paralyze / Sleep
Or prevent it entirely.
See the effects *paralyzed, sleep*

#### King's Last Drink
The King's Last Drink is a slow acting poison that creates two affects in its consumer. While this poison never kills its consumer, it does render them nearly functionless.
##### Truth
The first affect manifests before the other. After a full week of consumption, the consumer will be unable to speak a lie.
See *zone of truth*
##### Madness
After a month of consumption, the second portion of this poison takes effect, causing a maddening rage in its consumer.
See *crown of madness*

#### Stink
Stink is a gaseous poison that induces nausea and vomiting in those that inhale or otherwise consume it.
See *stinking cloud*

### Acids
#### Royal Water
This is one of the most powerful Acids an Alchemist can create. This is one of the few substances that would burn through alchemically enhanced solids.

#### Enchanter's Acid
Enchanter's Acid is also a very powerful acid, but only when in the presence of a Woven material, including Runes or Enchanted Objects.

## Gels
#### Dwarven / Gnomish Grease
This grease degrades very slowly, even under great stress, allowing for great works of engineering. As it is quite sticky, one must be very careful during the application process.

#### Scar Balm
A weak healing balm that removes scarring from skin when applied.

#### Heamox Balm
A powerful healing balm that, when correctly applied to wounds, heals both the external and internal wounds of the appliee. This includes, but is not limited to, Bleeding, Poison, Paralysis, and most Diseases (~*Keoghtom's Ointment*).

#### Zombaren Balm
A healing balm that prevents when correctly applied to wounds, fights against the permanent affects of being bitten by a Zombie, including Grave Rot, Pain, Stat Decrease, and Zombification.

#### Huumpo
This pink gel is extremely flammable, and alights on its own when exposed to oxygen.

## Solids
#### Alchemical Clay
Alchemical clay acts like normal clay in nearly every way, except that it is inert to nearly all magical or physical effects. While pieces formed of Alchemical Clay cannot shatter, chip, rust, or otherwise decay, they do dent well when exposed to mild force and an un-moving object. 

> All recipes of alchemical clay require a base of Philosipher's Stone and some inert clay. Other ingredients, and all processes are specific to their recipes.

#### Alchemical Fiber / Leather / Hide
Alchemical fibers have been treated by alchemical processes to be tougher and less reactive than their untreated counterparts.
##### Elvenfiber
Elvenfiber is a very rare material that is used to make *equipment of elvenkind*.
##### Animabric
Animabric is a fibrous material that is used to create cloaks and other clothing that hold Woven Patches and other Affects. It is formed from silk, and is *quite* expensive.

#### Black Steel
Black Steel is a steel formed alchemically that absorbs light and enhances the malleability of the Weave near it. While this makes forging something of the material even easier than steel, the same can be said of spellcasting while such an item is nearby.

#### Bituitem
A powerful coal-like substance. When used to mark an object, the mark would remain for many hundreds of years. When used as a fuel, the substance burns for multiple years at the same heat as coal of the same size. This substance can be used for extremely long lasting candles or markers when correctly shaped.
##### Magical Bituitem
Bituitem combined with Yellow Powder and reformed into markers allow for long-lasting Rune writings.

#### Pressigen
An alchemical fabric that acts similar to elastic. In addition to its stretching capabilities, it also conforms to an edge on its own; when used to create clothes or when acting as a sealant, the Pressigen squeezes to become water-tight against the object(s).

#### Pure Force
An extremely taxing material to produce, Pure Force is a measure of magically contained pressure that acts as a solid substance.

See *wall of force*.

#### Magical Bean
Traditionally, Magical Beans are used to store Weave Potentia, but they are valued as tokens of friendship between Alchemists and also provide novel although potentially dangerous entertainment when planted and watered.

## Powders
#### Alchemical / Magical Chalk
Alchemical Chalk is a common component in rituals and other magical happenings. It is produced by combining mundane chalk and Yellow Powder.

#### Alchemical Thermite
Alchemical Thermite is a powerful substance that burns extremely hot, long, and precise.

# Common Enchanter's Products
## Runes
Runes can be written in Magical Chalk or Magical Bituitem to invoke specific effects during ritual, but must become a part of the item they are affecting if the enchanter intends their effect to be permanent. Any "enchanted" item is created by applying runes to some portion of the item and invoking Weave Arcana upon the Rune.

Runes can take anywhere from an hour to multiple weeks.

#### Sensing

#### Spellbinding

#### Emotion
Some curses affect the user's mood.

#### Vulnerability
Some curses invoke vulnerability on a user, generally or specifically.

#### Harm

## Scrolls
When an enchanter is attempting to capture the effect of a specific spell, they will create a scroll. This process takes a variable amount of time, depending on the Grade of equipment they are using and the level of the spell they wish to Scroll. One can use the following expression to determine the time such an act would take.

(3 days^level of spell) / (grade of best equipment where Apprentice is .5)
