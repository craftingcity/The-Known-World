The essence of the world is a hyper mutable material given the name Weave. This is because the great creation legend, that of the whole multiverse, states that it was a trio of Weavers who created the multiverse from their own essence.

In everything, there is the Weave. This is the basis of Arcane magic.

Wizards have learned the incantations (generally originating from [[Draconic]], [[Celestial]], [[Infernal]], [[Abyssal]], or [[Mechanis(language)]]) to manipulate the latent Weave in objects and terrain around them, this is true of Druids as well, although their learning is more commonly imparted by elders and spirits than teachers and tomes. 

Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Bards are all similar, yet different. Much of the time, a member of any will have the ability to cast and sometimes even control their magic with little to no assistance. This is because these members have more direct access to rawer Weave, by birth-rite, purchase (ie once their full deal is complete, the claimed Weave is the Warlock's, no longer their Patron's being loaned. most Patrons circumvent this by setting their price at indefinite servitude, or a portion of the soul, or some other massive pricetag), or creativity respectively.

Clerics and Paladins are often closer to Warlocks than they would wish to admit, but they do gain their powers in exchange for Faith, the lifeblood of a God. Paladins need not make direct contact with a God, but the Oath that they swear, to themselves, to another, to a force, is edible as Faith to most any God, so most any God accepts Oaths that they enjoy even if they are not sworn to them. If a Paladin swears an Oath to the God of Peace, they may be inclined to genuinely deny the exchange, or, exchange this oath for something else from a God who more enjoy it more. Clerics deal directly with their deities (again, like a warlock does), and exchange their Faith for power in a manner that puts them in the role of a servant to their master, lest their power be taken from them.
