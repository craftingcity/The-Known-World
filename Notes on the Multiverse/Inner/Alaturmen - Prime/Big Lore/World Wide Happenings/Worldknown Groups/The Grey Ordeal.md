# The Grey Ordeal

A group of adventurers that had a powerful impact on this world.

They formed in 74 AF, when they began to do small tasks for an [[The Old Man]], whose name has been lost to time. Quickly, The Grey Ordeal defeated many local monstrosity, took a small break to revel in their local victories, and re-focused when the Old Man called for them to fight the demon Prince Orcus, Lord of the Undead. They were successful in their endeavor, but not without repercussion.

In 93 AF, they truly settled down and put their focus on mentoring the [[Guilds]]. 

Members include:
[[Tubric Millstone Wrinsmith]]
[[Eladrithal Greystone]]
[[Waywalket Turring]]
