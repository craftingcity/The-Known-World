# Description
Any sort of local lore...

## Physicality of the Holding
Baskin was recently attacked by a raid of Ice Giants (see [[The Assault of the Giant Decenters]]). Its stone buildings are deteriorating and rubbled, but most of the buildings in the center of the city are survived.

## Population Distribution
A large population of Orc live here, and the Grand Tendered is a green dragonborn, this leads the city to be quite exotic in comparison.

## Defenses

## Notable Locations
- the destroyed church
- 

## NPCs
- [[Enoch Ben]], captain of the guard
- [[Valerio Avishalom]], Grand Tendered of Baskin
