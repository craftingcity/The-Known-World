While no major holdings are in the Grumbling Hills, the much [[Hillkeep Loyalists]] make their home here. The Hillkeep Clan of Hill Dwarves founded the [[Darnt Hillkeep]], but could found no Kingdom, lest they wish to make war against the - at the time - powerful [[Bandit Lords]]. Now the Hills of Ameerinthia find themselves tred upon by all manner of foot, though still the Hill Dwarves most of all.
