Let me tell you a story...

# In the Beginning
In the Time before Time, for a moment and forever, the goblins thrived in the soup of Primordial nothing. Right after that, one single moment later, [[Tetrimoc]] split the heavens of Alaturmen and threw himself down unto it. There he was given his first wound by the lone mountain known now as Kailkeep. 

From the blood sprayed across this mountain rose the Kobolds of Kailkeep. Long did they wait for their Master to claim them, but he slept for too long, his injury too large. The Kobolds claimed themselves, disavowed their creator god and swore to work only for themselves. Without the direction of Tetrimoc, they became wicked and cruel.

Kailkeep is a massive complex dug by a fanatical group of Kobold for two main purposes; first, the safety of themselves, and second, the torment of others. These kobolds are craft.

They rule this massive complex, and even stronger monsters respect them as the true keepers of Kailkeep – except one, with whom the collective of kobold work as equal: Terra, the Idol of Earth. Why Terra began to work with them, I would dare not ask, but she has become as horrible as they are.

## Hooks
### Druids of Terra
For some time, the Druids of Terra were hidden, guarding the secrets of Arcane magic. Recently, the druid's connection to Terra has been severed – for reasons they would not share, even if they knew – and many of their texts have been stolen. Perhaps the adventurers were exploring and stumbled upon the hidden druids, or were sought out for their prowess. In either case, if the Druids can trust them, they would ask for their assistance in these affairs. And even if they can't be trusted, maybe they would anyways, but be prepared to ambush these assholes right after they find the goods.

### Missing People
For as long as there has been a mountain, there have been people bored enough to want to climb it. When those people travel to Kailkeep, either for fun or profit, they do not return. The explorer's husband is distraught, as is the Cartagrophers' Guild, and so too are the dwarfs, who are failing to set up a remote operation without their Quartermaster, Explosives Expert, and Cook.

### God-damn Raiders!
The inhabitants of Kailkeep are sustained by hunting as well as gathering. When people are not coming to them, they must come to people. If the Kobolds have been having a rough year, they'll either send raids themselves or order one of the factions under their command to raid for them.

### Arcane Hotspot
In my world, Alaturmen, magic is not common. The amount of magical items alone would ping someone's radar, let alone the powerful primordial force of Terra forsaking her druids and moving into a mountain. Anyone attuned to the Weave feels the heat of density in the area of Kailkeep, even from afar.

If your setting is of a higher commonality of magic, this hook becomes much simpler; go get the loot.

## Outline
### The Kobold's Goals
1. First and foremost, the Kobolds of Kailkeep want to protect themselves. Their collective survival is the most important thing to them both as a collective and individually; a Kobold values their clutchmate's security over their own life if they fucked up and got caught out.
2. Secondarily, the Kobolds want to gain more power than they have now. Again, this is true of the individual and the collective, some Kobolds run the Hells for a chance for a change of fate, and all Kobolds want Kobolds to rule Alaturmen, just like everyone else.
3. Tertiarily, the Kobolds want to appease their partner, Terra, and their followers. The easiest way to do that is to entertain them.

### Kailkeep's Secrets
#### Proving Grounds
While the Hells of Kailkeep are used as a method of collecting resources, punishing wrongdoers, and entertaining the masses, it also acts as a system of recruitment; "Hey, if you're good enough to do that once, we'll kit you out and pay you to keep doing this". Sometimes the winners say yes. Other times, they do not truly win.

#### Vast Arcane Power
For whatever reason, the Kobolds of Kailkeep have access to Terran's great powers and have used them to create structures of stone nearly at will. Terran also has enchanted the mountain, preventing unwanted manipulation of the mountain stone.

#### Curse Factory
Of the many arcane secrets the Kobolds of Kailkeep have mastered, the art of creating cheap enchanted weaponry is one of them. The only cost is a curse! Some curses can be worked around, others cannot. Those that can are typically worn and reproduced for those that would this particular enchantment would benefit. Those that cannot are given as false boons to those inside the Hells, adding some Hope to their lives, and some spice to the Kobold's entertainment.

#### Corrupted Dragon
Long ago, when the Kobolds were first crafting Kailkeep's Hells, the dragons Kakurak and Luzikiemal visited. There, Kakurak met his greatest ally. And there, Luzikiemal perished. 

Since that time, the Kobolds of Kailkeep have reanimated and corrupted the corpse of Luzikiemal as a set piece in their entertainment.


### The Factions of Kailkeep
#### Kobolds
The Kobolds of Kailkeep have gone half-mad with the perceived betrayal of their Blood-Master [[Tetrimoc]]. They are the rulers of Kailkeep, and the other inhabitants know it. They formed and maintain the Hells for their entertainment and to collect power in the form of equipment or recruits.

Groups of Kobold who commit a grievous crime are sentenced to Kailkeep's Hells. Some Kobold who feel they have no other prospects volunteer as to enter the Hells as a Champion of Kailkeep.

The many kobold "civilians" who work and keep Kailkeep, both Hells and Proper, enjoy spending time with their clutchmates and watching the higher levels of the Hells on their free time. Some lucky kobold make good bets on particular newcomers and make spectacular winnings.

#### Inhabitants of Kailkeep
##### Goblin
##### Gnoll 
##### Ankheg
##### Red Wurm
##### Luzikiemal Risen
#### Invaders
##### Lost Thieves of Honor
A group of Honorable Thieves have found their way into the Hells of Kailkeep. They say they come from all over (ie, they are a mix from all three groups in the Desert), and they want nothing more than to get back to their families to make sure they are safe.

##### Golden Claws
A group of guardsfolk have found their way into the Hells of Kailkeep. They are extremely hostile to anyone who does not worship the same Deity as them (for my purposes, this is [[Tetrimoc]]), but would offer nearly anything to ones who bear its mark.

##### Dwarven Warriors
A group of dwarven warriors were tasked with the removal of Kobolds threatening their ([[Mountain Hall]]) supply lines, and cannot report back that Kailkeep is a much larger bite of evil than a group of its size could handle.

##### Unwitting Participants
Many of Kailkeep's "invaders" were people taken to the Hells during a slower time for the Kobold's entertainment. Some have banded together into small packs, doing what they must to survive together.

### Kailkeep's Features
#### Terra's Mountain
The Idol of Earth (or another powerful-earth-manipulating entity who would fit) Terra has claimed this mountain as her lair. Whether that is a choice she made is up to you as the game-master. On Alaturmen, Terra abandoned her Druids after learning that her sibling, Anima, had betrayed Terra's secrets to their Druids without her permission or knowledge. In a fit of rage, she sundered her Druid's grove and took much of her own teachings with her as she fled to the greatest place of refuge known on Alaturmen; Kailkeep.

#### False Allure Architecture
In its lowest floors, the first three, it is a carefully crafted dungeon of false allure – stone cobble halls weaving a tale of mystery and woe, promises of dark treasures left behind in a great abandonment. The antagonist in this story is a Kobold Wizard who binds an elemental to do his bidding and destroy the people who were here before. As the story carved into the reliefs, columns, and in the arts remaining unfolds, it becomes more and more clear that this Antagonist is really our Protagonist, and the story of the lower levels twists into our Heroe's favor before...

#### Hells Architecture
The fourth level presents a drastic change of theme. Where once there was red cobble and dusty crypt, there is flat black marble and translucently thin stone stronger than steel surrounded by blasts of color and symbol. Beyond the first three levels, the dungeons of Kailkeep serve as a mix of entertainment, punishment, and training for the inhabitants of Kailkeep.

Those who enter Kailkeep's Hells *cannot* return from whence they came. The only exit is forward. Up.

##### Ceilings
The ceilings of Kailkeep's Hells are crafted to fit large creatures, the distance from ceiling to floor is typically eighteen feet.

##### Veiwings and Tunnels
In some places of Kailkeep, there are windows of an incredibly thin, strong, and translucent stone. Behind them, Kobolds gather to view and bet on their favorite teams inside Kailkeep's Hells.

Between the areas of viewing, there are tunnels sized for two small creatures to walk side by side, about five by four and a half feet and spiraling staircases of similar sizing between levels.

##### Doors, Secret Doors, and Ko-Bolted Doors.
Beyond the "false allure" of Kailkeep's Lower Hells, Normal Doors (including double doors) are made of two inch thick black marble, and are handled in one-half inch thick white marble rings. These doors have no hinges, swinging around an internal cylinder that holds the door in place in the wall.

The secret doors of Kailkeep are not uniform, but they are hidden similarly. Any and all secret doors marked on the maps are humbly suggested to require a DC 20 investigation check to notice, although surely some are easier or harder to spot then others. Please use your discretion.

Some doors in Kailkeep are "ko-bolted", meaning they cannot (as enforced by Terra's magic) be opened by any other than a living Kobold who has been Marked with the correct Access Bindings.
> ###### What the fuck is an Access Binding??
> It's like a keycard in a video game, except its a magic tattoo. Only certain Kobolds get access to the tunnel doors on certain levels, bc you dont need the dude who maintains the slime pits in the False Allure rooms, what if he goops the place up? No-one with an Access Binding is allowed to entertain in the Hells, for the hopefully obvious reason of the massive advantage they would have against their foes, but they do maintenance work whenever an area is clear of entertainers, and will shut areas down using Terran's magic if maintenance is urgent.

##### Illumination
The Kobolds who view the Hells as entertainment have no need for light, except in the larger rooms of the Hells, in which case the # bioluminescent mushroom Glowbulb has been cultivated. In most cases, the light the entertainers provide for themselves is sufficient.


## Greater Map
Kailkeep has been crafted from the stone of the mountain by Kobolds for hundreds of years. It is so large and complex a structure that not all of it could be displayed here. Perhaps no matter where the players ascend from, they enter the next level presented here, some intervention by the fates, perhaps. That is not for me to decide, but you must know that the levels presented here only explore the tip of this massive structure.

The first three levels present very little challenge to even the greenest adventurers. Veterans should be presented with the feeling of unease, a prey standing too still – a hunter being hunted.

Above the third Level, Kailkeep presents a challenge constructed for three to five level five adventurers working together as a team with limited information about the truest natures of Kailkeep. A map of Kailkeep's Hells would be *wish*ful thinking to acquire outside of the Hells themselves, and even then, the procurement of such a valuable piece of information would be quite the feat – let alone the questions of Kailkeep's ability to even be mapped.

### Level Four: Let the Games Begin!
There are three variations of this "floor", though room is a better descriptor. 

#### 1. Pressure
Four bowls rest on four pressure plates on their four platforms in the four corners of the room.

##### Bowls

##### Plates
The plates are set to detect thirty pounds of weight applied directly downwards. Once all four plates are triggered at the same time, the trapdoor to level five 

##### Platform
Each of the platforms depict a Kobold giving something. One shows a kobold willingly giving coins, another willingly giving food, another willingly giving his own blood, and other full of burning books.

#### 2. Spikes and Oil

#### 3. Sand Table
This is a timed puzzle room. On the walls there are etchings of the Mountain Kailkeep is in, and a table with a lowered center (8") that contains to its brim and overflown onto the floor - as if sweeped off - a fine red sand.

##### The Sand
A lil bit of something for yah, the table holds exactly 33 pounds of dry red sand, but when the kobolds reset the room, they use units of 35, and sweep the rest onto the floor. This means that there are two "un/intentional" extra pounds of dry sand. That very quickly become wet. And or flown down to the blocked sewer **Below the Table**.

##### The Vision Columns
As the stairs close behind the poor souls given this task, the vision columns fire up, and its runes hum and generate a fine dust that swirls together to form an image of a room of Kobold. These kobold begin to, out loud, in [[Draconic]], note defining features of each of the observed. After the Kobolds finish, the dust disappears and the vision fades. The **Mouths** begin to pour.

##### The Sand Table
Under the four legs of the table that holds the sand are pressure plates that are wired to detect an exact pressure-weight-degree. A cone of this dry red sand that is six inches taller than the outer edge of the table and or fourteen inches taller than the floor of the table's recess with a radius of 1.5' triggers these plates. in the center of the 8' by 5' rectangular table. This table contains a 7' by 4' by 8" recess build to contain the 33 pounds of sand found set in the table. 

This cone, when composed of entirely the dry red sand weighs 33 pounds exactly. Wet sand weighs twice as much as dry sand, meaning a cone of entirely wet sand need only be half as large – but still the same dimension. When using both wet and dry sand, use your discretion, let the dice tell the story, or do a bunch of boring math in the middle of the session. One of those three is bad advice. No~! You have to guess!

##### Below the Table
Below the table is a three-foot diameter spindled adamentine grate drains into a cylinder in the floor. After two feet, this cylinder thins to two inches. A stone trap-wall closes at the same time as the stairs here, trapping the sewage from the Mouths in with those who triggered the stairs. Austensibly, a mage comes and spews water everywhere, then someone comes and resets the sand, and then the room is ready to go again.

##### The Mouths of Refuse
In each of the four ceiling-corners of the room, there are four stone statues of winged kobold sticking there, their mouths agape. After the Vision Columns are finished, the **Mouths** begin to stream a brown water into the room. This is Kailkeep's sewage. 

##### Art of Kailkeep
The Art of Kailkeep has the exact dimensions that are required for the plates below the table to trigger. 

Anyone who has a good eye for art or difference in works (or both, like a forger) would notice the softer texture of the mountain art compared to the walls of the room. 

The Kobolds had one specific idea for what this symbolizes, build this, exactly, with this soft sand from our home. Or die, in our shit.

##### Ko-bolted Access Door
A door in the opposite wall as the Art of Kailkeep made of adamentine is marked with the [[Draconic]] rune that indicates our concept of three in the lower center of the door, and a small kobold-palm-shaped indentation marked with the same symbol on the palm, but smaller, above the rune.
