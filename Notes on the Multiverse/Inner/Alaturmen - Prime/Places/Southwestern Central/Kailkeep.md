Let me tell you a story...

# In the Beginning
In the Time before Time, for a moment and forever, the goblins thrived in the soup of Primordial nothing. Right after that, one single moment later, [[Tetrimoc]] split the heavens of Alaturmen and threw himself down unto it. There he was given his first wound by the lone mountain known now as Kailkeep. 

From the blood sprayed across this mountain rose the Kobolds of Kailkeep. Long did they wait for their Master to claim them, but he slept for too long, his injury too large. The Kobolds claimed themselves, disavowed their creator god and swore to work only for themselves. Without the direction of Tetrimoc, they became wicked and cruel.

Kailkeep is a massive complex dug by a fanatical group of Kobold for two main purposes; first, the safety of themselves, and second, the torment of others. These kobolds are craft.

They rule this massive complex, and even stronger monsters respect them as the true keepers of Kailkeep – except one, with whom the collective of kobold work as equal: Terra, the Idol of Earth. Why Terra began to work with them, I would dare not ask, but she has become as horrible as they are.

## Hooks
### Druids of Terra
For some time, the Druids of Terra were hidden, guarding the secrets of Arcane magic. Recently, the druid's connection to Terra has been severed – for reasons they would not share, even if they knew – and many of their texts have been stolen. Perhaps the adventurers were exploring and stumbled upon the hidden druids, or were sought out for their prowess. In either case, if the Druids can trust them, they would ask for their assistance in these affairs. And even if they can't be trusted, maybe they would anyways, but be prepared to ambush these assholes right after they find the goods.

### Missing People
For as long as there has been a mountain, there have been people bored enough to want to climb it. When those people travel to Kailkeep, either for fun or profit, they do not return. The explorer's husband is distraught, as is the Cartagrophers' Guild, and so too are the dwarfs, who are failing to set up a remote operation without their Quartermaster, Explosives Expert, and Cook.

### God-damn Raiders!
The inhabitants of Kailkeep are sustained by hunting as well as gathering. When people are not coming to them, they must come to people. If the Kobolds have been having a rough year, they'll either send raids themselves or order one of the factions under their command to raid for them.

### Arcane Hotspot
In my world, Alaturmen, magic is not common. The amount of magical items alone would ping someone's radar, let alone the powerful primordial force of Terra forsaking her druids and moving into a mountain. Anyone attuned to the Weave feels the heat of density in the area of Kailkeep, even from afar.

If your setting is of a higher commonality of magic, this hook becomes much simpler; go get the loot.

## Outline
### The Kobold's Goals
1. First and foremost, the Kobolds of Kailkeep want to protect themselves. Their collective survival is the most important thing to them both as a collective and individually; a Kobold values their clutchmate's security over their own life if they fucked up and got caught out.
2. Secondarily, the Kobolds want to gain more power than they have now. Again, this is true of the individual and the collective, some Kobolds run the Hells for a chance for a change of fate, and all Kobolds want Kobolds to rule Alaturmen, just like everyone else.
3. Tertiarily, the Kobolds want to appease their partner, Terra, and maintain their followers. The best way to do that is to make sure that they are housed, fed, entertained, and willing to die for their cause.

### Kailkeep's Secrets
#### Proving Grounds
While the Hells of Kailkeep are used as a method of collecting resources, punishing wrongdoers, and entertaining the masses, it also acts as a system of recruitment; "Hey, if you're good enough to do that once, we'll kit you out and pay you to keep doing this". Sometimes the winners say yes. Other times, they do not truly win.

#### Vast Arcane Power
For whatever reason, the Kobolds of Kailkeep have access to Terran's great powers and have used them to create structures of stone nearly at will. Terran also has enchanted the mountain, preventing unwanted manipulation of the mountain stone.

#### Curse Factory
Of the many arcane secrets the Kobolds of Kailkeep have mastered, the art of creating cheap enchanted weaponry is one of them. The only cost is a curse! Some curses can be worked around, others cannot. Those that can are typically worn and reproduced for those that would this particular enchantment would benefit. Those that cannot are given as false boons to those inside the Hells, adding some Hope to their lives, and some spice to the Kobold's entertainment.

#### Corrupted Dragon
Long ago, when the Kobolds were first crafting Kailkeep's Hells, the dragons Kakurak and Luzikiemal visited. There, Kakurak met his greatest ally. And there, Luzikiemal perished. 

Since that time, the Kobolds of Kailkeep have reanimated and corrupted the corpse of Luzikiemal as a set piece in their entertainment.


### The Factions of Kailkeep
#### Kobolds
The Kobolds of Kailkeep have gone half-mad with the perceived betrayal of their Blood-Master [[Tetrimoc]]. They are the rulers of Kailkeep, and the other inhabitants know it. They formed and maintain the Hells for their entertainment and to collect power in the form of equipment or recruits.

##### Operators
Trusted members of Kailkeep are called to operate the mechanisms of Kailkeep, referee games, and otherwise maintain the Hells of Kailkeep. Often times, Operators will take after certain groups of Entertainers and leave them messages or gifts to find, be them boons or betrayals.

##### Civilians
The many kobolds who live and work in Kailkeep enjoy spending time with their clutchmates watching the higher levels of the Hells on their free time. Some lucky kobold make good bets on particular newcomers and make spectacular winnings.

##### Entertainers
Groups of Kobold who commit a grievous crime are sentenced to Kailkeep's Hells. Some Kobold who feel they have no other prospects volunteer as to enter the Hells as a Champion of Kailkeep. In either case, Kobolds are feared in the Hells, and are often submitted to without question for fear of retribution by the Operators.

#### Entertainer Factions
##### Goblin
Most goblin living in Kailkeep came seeking treasure or purpose, and found instead their need to survive.

Goblin of Alaturmen love a good fight, and what's better than a massive complex dedicated to fighting in competition for acceptance by a clan of mad kobold!? 

##### Gnoll 
Gnoll of the Desert have taken residence in Kailkeep. Here they can satisfy their hunger and find safety from the persecution of others of the "civilized" world.

##### Ankheg
A family of Ankheg have been husbanded for food and defense, and will work together with those who can communicate with them and form a deal that it would honor.

##### Red Wurm
A family of Red Wurm have been husbanded for food and defense, and these six-inch diameter, 3 foot long Wurms carry a powerful bite and dexterous wriggle.

##### Luzikiemal Risen
Luzikiemal, Corrupted is a draco-lich of a young brass dragon. He resides in the Upper levels of Kailkeep as an eternal favorite bet for the Kobold Viewers, though he never moves beyond the Ninth Floor.

#### Invaders
##### Lost Thieves of Honor
A group of Honorable Thieves have found their way into the Hells of Kailkeep. They say they come from all over (ie, they are a mix from all three groups in the Desert), and they want nothing more than to get back to their families to make sure they are safe.

##### Golden Claws
A group of humanoid guards from a nearby bastion of civilization have found their way into the Hells of Kailkeep. They are extremely hostile to anyone who does not worship the same Deity as them (for my purposes, this is [[Tetrimoc]]), but would offer nearly anything to ones who openly bear their Diety's mark.

##### Dwarven Warriors
A group of dwarven warriors (for my purposes, they come from [[Mountain Hall]]) were tasked with the removal of Kobolds threatening their supply lines, and cannot report back that Kailkeep is a much larger bite of evil than a group of its size could handle.

##### Unwitting Participants
Many of Kailkeep's "invaders" were people taken to the Hells during a slower time for the Kobold's entertainment. Some have banded together into small packs, doing what they must to survive together.

### Kailkeep's Features
#### Terra's Mountain
The Idol of Earth (or another powerful-earth-manipulating entity who would fit) Terra has claimed this mountain as her lair. Whether that is a choice she made is up to you as the game-master. On Alaturmen, Terra abandoned her Druids after learning that her sibling, Anima, had betrayed Terra's secrets to their Druids without her permission or knowledge. In a fit of rage, she sundered her Druid's grove and took much of her own teachings with her as she fled to the greatest place of refuge known on Alaturmen; Kailkeep.

#### False Allure Architecture
In its lowest floors, the first three, it is a carefully crafted dungeon of false allure – stone cobble halls weaving a tale of mystery and woe, promises of dark treasures left behind in a great abandonment. The antagonist in this story is a Kobold Wizard who binds an elemental to do his bidding and destroy the people who were here before. As the story carved into the reliefs, columns, and in the arts remaining unfolds, it becomes more and more clear that this Antagonist is really our Protagonist, and the story of the lower levels twists into our Heroe's favor before...

#### Hells Architecture
The fourth level presents a drastic change of theme. Where once there was red cobble and dusty crypt, there is flat black marble and translucently thin stone stronger than steel surrounded by blasts of color and symbol. Beyond the first three levels, the dungeons of Kailkeep serve as a mix of entertainment, punishment, and training for the inhabitants of Kailkeep.

Those who enter Kailkeep's Hells *cannot* return from whence they came. The only exit is forward. Up.

##### Scoreboards
Throughout the Hells, there are scoreboards displaying the betting odds for the packs of Entertainers in the Hells on the current level. These scoreboards are maintained by Operators in real time, and it is a popular scene when teams of entertainers clash in front of a scoreboard.

##### Ceilings
The ceilings of Kailkeep's Hells are crafted to fit large creatures, the distance from ceiling to floor is typically eighteen feet.

##### Veiwings and Tunnels
In some places of Kailkeep, there are windows of an incredibly thin, strong, and translucent stone. Behind them, Kobolds gather to view and bet on their favorite teams inside Kailkeep's Hells.

Between the areas of viewing, there are tunnels sized for two small creatures to walk side by side, about five by four and a half feet and spiraling staircases of similar sizing between levels.

##### Dead Ends and Past Messages
Dead ends are marked with a large draconic rune that reads "HALT" and bare no consistent features beyond this.

Many of these dead ends attract messages from previous visitors, although they can be found throughout the Kailkeep Hells, and any such messages become framed and dated by Operators moments after they are completed.

##### Doors, Secret Doors, and Ko-Bolted Doors.
Beyond the "false allure" of Kailkeep's Lower Hells, Normal Doors (including double doors) are made of two inch thick black marble, and are handled in one-half inch thick white marble rings. These doors have no hinges, swinging around an internal cylinder that holds the door in place in the wall.

The secret doors of Kailkeep are not uniform, but they are hidden similarly. Any and all secret doors marked on my maps are humbly suggested to require a DC 20 investigation check to notice, although surely some are easier or harder to spot than others. Please use your discretion.

Some doors in Kailkeep are "ko-bolted", locked by Operator's magics to be opened only by a living Kobold Marked with the correct Access Bindings.

> ###### What the fuck is an Access Binding??
> It's like a keycard in a video game, except its a magic kobold tattoo.
>  
> Only certain Kobolds get access to the tunnel doors on certain levels, because you don't need the dude who maintains the slime pits in the False Allure rooms; what if he goops the place up? 
> 
> No-one with an Access Binding is allowed to entertain in the Hells, for the hopefully obvious reason of the massive advantage they would have against their foes. 
> 
> Some Marked perform maintenance work in areas that are clear of Entertainers, and Operators will shut areas down if that maintenance is urgent.

##### Illumination
The Kobolds who view the Hells as entertainment or contest have no need for light, except for in the larger rooms of the Hells, in which case the bioluminescent mushroom Glowbulb has been cultivated to provide low light. In most cases, the light the entertainers provide for themselves is sufficient.


## Greater Map
Kailkeep has been crafted from the stone of the mountain by Kobolds for hundreds of years. It is so large and complex a structure that not all of it could be displayed here. Perhaps no matter where the players ascend from, they enter the next level presented here, some intervention by the fates, perhaps. That is not for me to decide, but you must know that the levels presented here only explore the tip of this massive structure.

The first three levels present very little challenge to even the greenest adventurers. Veterans should be presented with the feeling of unease, a prey standing too still – a hunter being hunted.

Above the third Level, Kailkeep presents a challenge constructed for three to five level five adventurers working together as a team with limited information about the truest natures of Kailkeep. A map of Kailkeep's Hells would be *wish*ful thinking to acquire outside of the Hells themselves, and even then, the procurement of such a valuable piece of information would be quite the feat – let alone the questions of Kailkeep's ability to even be mapped.

## False Allure
### Level One: Hook
Level One of Kailkeep's False Allure presents itself as the bottom floor of a rising dwarven fortress. The artistry present in this level tells the story of Kailkeep in falsehood, positing that Kobolds of great Arcane Power took this mountain from a clan of dwarves. 

The kobolds intend to bring those that have come here deeper into Kailkeep. This level is purposefully accessible and the threats that make their home here are purposefully weak – Entertainers who have ascended the Hells are ordered return to the False Allure if they refuse to entertain. 

Anyone with knowledge of dwarven history or architecture would know that no dwarves have lived here, and this art and architecture is not dwarven in nature. These falsehoods are also detectable in the other floors of the False Allure as well.

### Level Two: Line
Level Two of Kailkeep continues to present itself as this false dwarven keep and continues to the tale of the Kobolds and the Dwarves, though the intent of the artistry twists – these arcane invaders were actually good, the mountain was happy that they had driven the dwarves away.

### Level Three: Sinker
Level Three of Kailkeep begins to close this false tale of Kobold heroism against the horrid, cruel, mountain-scarring dwarves, and how the kobolds finally made their home in these "dwarven" halls, but keep these lower levels empty as an honor to their fallen comrades.

## Hells of Kailkeep
### Level Four: Let the Games Begin!
And the rug is ripped from under them. There never was a dwarven clan! It was the kobolds the whole time! And here they are, front and center, laughing away at the newcomer-fools. 

#### Gimmik
This level is a series of harmful obstacles designed to test the newcomer's resolve, but not yet their life – let that rest in the hands of the other entertainers. Simple traps and puzzles, but this is the first level on which there are other entertainers – the signs of life are overwhelming.

#### Moving On
Continuing onward into Level Five is not a difficulty, but avoiding the traps that guard the stairs could be perceived as such.

### Level Five: Four Corners
#### Gimmik
Four towers forming a square in equidistance hold the only exits beyond, leading to funneling of entertainers. It is the intent of this floor to force interaction between groups of entertainers that have progressed this far.

#### Moving On
This level has many entrances from floors below, but very few exits to floors beyond. 

### Level Six: Pick-up Sticks
#### Gimmik
Hidden about this level, some found by other entertainers, are the arcane keys to the levels beyond. These keys take the form of medallions marked with integers and operations.

#### Moving On
In a similar manner to the floors below, progress beyond floor six is restricted. Any who wish to open the levels above must open large vault doors locked by Weave Arcane and marked with triple digit numbers. If one wishes to progress, they must provide medallions that produce a valid expression that is equal in sum to the value of the door they are attempting to open.

### Level Seven: Kadabbi
#### Gimmik
As entertainers ascend to Level Seven they are paired with others until they form a group of seven. Then, they enter an enchanted game of Kadabbi where one member of the team of seven becomes the tagger, and must use their now crackling electric hands to tag the members of the other team. A stipulation; the taggers (and I suppose the taggies) cannot breathe on the opposite side of their field. If a tagger dies, their power is granted to another random taggie from their team.

Game-rooms and Teams are separated and managed by kobold Geomancers harnessing Terra's power from special Operation Viewing areas.
#### Moving On
A team moves on together after two victories over two other teams.

### Level Eight: Here Comes an Old Soldier from Wish Bay
#### Gimmik
#### Moving On
### Level Nine: The Floor is Ooze!
#### Gimmik
#### Moving On
### Level Ten: Fight to the Death
#### Gimmik
#### Moving On
## Home Sweet Home
### Level Eleven: Welcome Home!
### Level Twelve: Work and Live
### Level Thirteen: Defense From Above
