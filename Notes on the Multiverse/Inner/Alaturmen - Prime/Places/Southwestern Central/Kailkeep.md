Let me tell you a story...

# In the Beginning
In the Time before Time, for a moment and forever, the goblins thrived in the soup of Primodial nothing. Right after that, one single moment later, [[Tetrimoc]] split the heavens of Alaturmen and threw himself down unto it. There he was given his first wound by the lone mountain known now as Kailkeep. 

From the blood sprayed across this mountain rose the Kobolds of Kailkeep. Long did they wait for their Master to claim them, but he slept for too long, his injury too large. The Kobolds claimed themselves, disavowed their creator god and swore to work only for themselves. Without the direction of Tetrimoc, they became wicked and cruel.

Kailkeep is a massive complex dug by a fanatical group of Kobold for two main purposes; first, the safety of themselves, and second, the torment of others. These kobolds are craft.

They rule this massive complex, and even stronger monsters respect them as the true keepers of Kailkeep â€“ except one, with whom the collective of kobold work as equal: Terra, the Idol of Earth. Why Terra began to work with them, I would dare not ask, but she has become as horrible as they are.

## Hooks
### Druids of Terra
For some time, the Druids of Terra were hidden, guarding the secrets of Arcane magic. Recently, the druid's connection to Terra has been severed, and many of their texts have been stolen. Perhaps the adventurers were exploring and stumbled upon the hidden druids, or were sought out for their prowess.
