Let me tell you a story...

# In the Beginning
In the Time before Time, for a moment and forever, the goblins thrived in the soup of Primordial nothing. Right after that, one single moment later, [[Tetrimoc]] split the heavens of Alaturmen and threw himself down unto it. There he was given his first wound by the lone mountain known now as Kailkeep. 

From the blood sprayed across this mountain rose the Kobolds of Kailkeep. Long did they wait for their Master to claim them, but he slept for too long, his injury too large. The Kobolds claimed themselves, disavowed their creator god and swore to work only for themselves. Without the direction of Tetrimoc, they became wicked and cruel.

Kailkeep is a massive complex dug by a fanatical group of Kobold for two main purposes; first, the safety of themselves, and second, the torment of others. These kobolds are craft.

They rule this massive complex, and even stronger monsters respect them as the true keepers of Kailkeep – except one, with whom the collective of kobold work as equal: Terra, the Idol of Earth. Why Terra began to work with them, I would dare not ask, but she has become as horrible as they are.

## Hooks
### Druids of Terra
For some time, the Druids of Terra were hidden, guarding the secrets of Arcane magic. Recently, the druid's connection to Terra has been severed – for reasons they would not share, even if they knew – and many of their texts have been stolen. Perhaps the adventurers were exploring and stumbled upon the hidden druids, or were sought out for their prowess. In either case, if the Druids can trust them, they would ask for their assistance in these affairs. And even if they can't be trusted, maybe they would anyways, but be prepared to ambush these assholes right after they find the goods.

### Missing People
For as long as there has been a mountain, there have been people bored enough to want to climb it. When those people travel to Kailkeep, either for fun or profit, they do not return. The explorer's husband is distraught, as is the Cartagrophers' Guild, and so too are the dwarfs, who are failing to set up a remote operation without their Quartermaster, Explosives Expert, and Cook.

### God-damn Raiders!
The inhabitants of Kailkeep are sustained by hunting as well as gathering. When people are not coming to them, they must come to people. If the Kobolds have been having a rough year, they'll either send raids themselves or order one of the factions under their command to raid for them.

### Arcane Hotspot
In my world, Alaturmen, magic is not common. The amount of magical items alone would ping someone's radar, let alone the powerful primordial force of Terra forsaking her druids and moving into a mountain. Anyone attuned to the Weave feels the heat of density in the area of Kailkeep, even from afar.

If your setting is of a higher commonality of magic, this hook becomes much simpler; go get the loot.

## Outline
### The Kobold's Goals
### The Factions of Kailkeep
#### Kobolds
The Kobolds of Kailkeep have gone half-mad with the perceived betrayal of their Blood-Master [[Tetrimoc]]. They are the rulers of Kailkeep, and the other inhabitants know it. They formed and maintain the Hells for their entertainment and to collect power in the form of equipment or recruits.

Groups of Kobold who commit a grievous crime are sentenced to Kailkeep's Hells. Some Kobold who feel they have no other prospects volunteer as to enter the Hells as a Champion of Kailkeep.

The many kobold "civilians" who work and keep Kailkeep, both Hells and Proper, enjoy spending time with their clutchmates and watching the higher levels of the Hells on their free time. Some lucky kobold make good bets on particular newcomers and make spectacular winnings.

### Kailkeep's Features
#### Terra's Mountain
The Idol of Earth (or another powerful-earth-manipulating entity who would fit) Terra has claimed this mountain as her lair. Whether that is a choice she made is up to you as the game-master. On Alaturmen, Terra abandoned her Druids after learning that her sibling, Anima, had betrayed Terra's secrets to their Druids without her permission or knowledge. In a fit of rage, she sundered her Druid's grove and took much of her own teachings with her as she fled to the greatest place of refuge known on Alaturmen; Kailkeep.
#### Architecture
Kailkeep has been crafted from the stone of the mountain by Kobolds for hundreds of years. In its lowest floors, the first three, it is a carefully crafted dungeon of false allure - stone cobble halls weaving a tale of mystery and woe, promises of dark treasures left behind in a great abandonment. The antagonist in this story is a Kobold Wizard who binds an elemental to do his bidding and destroy the people who were here before. As the story carved into the reliefs, columns, and in the arts remaining unfolds, it becomes more and more clear that this Antagonist is really our Protagonist, and the story of the lower levels twists into our Heroe's favor before...

The fourth level is a drastic change of theme. Where once there was red cobble and dusty crypt, there is translucently thin stone stronger than steel and flat black marble surrounded by blasts of color and symbol. Beyond the first three levels, the dungeons of Kailkeep serve as a mix of entertainment, punishment, and training for the inhabitants of Kailkeep.

Those who enter Kailkeep's Hells *cannot* return from whence they came. The only exit is forward. Up.

##### Ceilings
The ceilings of Kailkeep's Hells are crafted to fit large creatures, the distance from ceiling to floor is typically eighteen feet.

##### Veiwings and Tunnels
In some places of Kailkeep, there are windows of an incredibly thin, strong, and translucent stone. Behind them, Kobolds gather to view and bet on their favorite teams inside Kailkeep's Hells.

Between the areas of viewing, there are tunnels sized for two small creatures to walk side by side, about five by four and a half feet and spiraling staircases of similar sizing between levels.

##### Doors, Secret Doors, and Ko-Bolted Doors.

Beyond the "false allure" of Kailkeep's Lower Hells, Normal Doors (including double doors) are made of two inch thick black marble.

##### Illumination
The Kobolds who view the Hells as entertainment have no need for light, except in the larger rooms of the Hells, in which case the # bioluminescence Glowbulb has been cultivated. In most cases, the light the entertainers provide for themselves is sufficient.
