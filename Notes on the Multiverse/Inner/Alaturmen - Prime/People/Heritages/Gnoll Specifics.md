## Legends from Beyond the Material Plane
The tale of the Gnoll begins with Orcus' invasion, when the Demon Prince of the Undead created the Gnolls as a occupying army for his to-be-conquered territory.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Gnolls reproduce sexually, and generally have children in litters. Their teeth and claws allow them to become dominant predators quickly. A Gnoll becomes an adult upon their first kill. Gnolls live for about forty years.

A Gnoll, no matter their place of birth or culture is born with a powerful internal hunger - most commonly this manifests as some form of substance abuse, but some are known to hunger for death or power or lust or other less than physical substances.

The largest population of Gnolls live in [[The Outlands]] in nomadic tribes.
