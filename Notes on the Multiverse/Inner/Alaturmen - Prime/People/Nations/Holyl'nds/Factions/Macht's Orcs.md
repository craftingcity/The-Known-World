Macht's Orcs are the first band of [[Orc Specifics]] brought to the plane of Alaturmen. They were used by slaves by the Cheiftan Whats-His-Name during his life and in [[The Assault of the Giant Decenters]], at which point he was slain, and his name was lost to time, and his slaves were freed! 

New orcs of this clan are born to their flesh-giver and [[Macht]], but soon he will be too old, and other shamans shall rise and form their own clans. Almost certainly, one of these born to him (perhaps specifically [[Macht Cala|his first born mage]]) would take his name and place for the existing clan, just as others would for their shaman.
