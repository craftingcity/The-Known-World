# The Church of the White Flame

The [[#The Church of the White Flame]] is the main body of government in the [[The Holyl'nds]], as a caste theocracy. They worship [[Its Greatness]] as a great force to be revered for its allowance of containment. 

## Castes
The Church of the White flame practices cultural racism.

Ranking from highest to lowest in station:
- Spoken (the few who draw holy power from White Flame, no matter their race, but we're still gonna look at them with *that* look)
- Firstchurch (highpreist, only based in the [[Holy City of Kanielkiln]], typically only human, half-elves, and elves can become Firstchurch)
	- While members of Firstchurch are supposedly, and technically truthfully, are not allowed outside of [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]], certain excelling members of Tendered are brought into the ranks of the Firstchurch by a council of 
- Tendered (a priest of a church or other establishment grown and raised for their position)
	- Certain jobs a Tendered undertakes earns them a special name. While this does come with a minor ascension in status, it is similar to a novice becoming a journeyman.
		- *Detainers* are Tendered who 
		- *Keepers* are Tendered who train captured slaves
- Patron (a patron of an establishment Tended by a member of The Church)
	- there is no difference between Patrons, although those who would train their children to become Tenderd
- Unseen (well trained goblin, bugbear, winter elves, orc)
	- this is the point at which systemic cultural racism takes its cut, and moves the profits upward from here
- (undesirable) ("wild" goblinoid, orc, "trainable" races)
	- while thier name suggests that one might get rid of them, the (undesireble) are a group that, when captured and enslaved, make wonderful Unseen. 
		- This is the job of select few Tended, known as Keepers.

## The Formal Journey
The Tendered are a priest class in the society of [[The Holyl'nds]]. They are taken at a young age to [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]] and raised by the Firstchurch. When they are ready, they begin their formal journey; They are ordained in filigree by their Firstchurch and ascend the 100 steps into the White Church. They are to be greeted by the Spoken of the church and given their flame. They then depart from the city in parade and glory. They will carry with them their flame where they go and tend it. Many start churches of their own and grow the flock of Patrons from the Unseen. Some settle otherwise, starting businesses, charities, or other organizations.

## The Truth
 > "The Great White Flame is not a "god" as you put it. When The Great Flame made armageddon of our holyl'nd many perished as non-believers. We are not fools. It is our master, not our god." - [[Gimish, of Firstchurch]]

[[Its Greatness]] looks upon you as you look upon it. 
Its Greatness judges you as you judge it. 
Its Greatness bestows unto you as you worship it.
Its Greatness is holy, right, and a gift to us.
We will share our gifts with the world.
