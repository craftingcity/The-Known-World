## The Democratic Combine of Peoples
![[combine-100AF.png]]
*Combine Territory as of 100AF*

The Democratic Combine of Peoples is a anarch-fiefdom-government that signed the [[Coalition's Founding Document]].

### Government
The Rulers of [[The Fiefdoms of the Combine]] conference often, and form their own alliances between themselves. The clauses in [[Coalition's Founding Document]] allow anyone that holds a fief (ie enough land to feed a knight) to represent the Combine in [[Communicae]].

### Population Distribution
- large swaths of the "exotic races" such as dragonborn, goliaths, tiefling, kenku, triton
- commonly find the "races of men", such as human, halflings, dwarves
- uncommonly find elven folk
- rarely feyborn or underkin, such as eladrin or duergar
