## Legends from... Alaturmen?
The first tales of the humans come from the Elves, but they lay no claim to progeny. They say they found the first generation of humans in the fields and forests, naked and hungry like any other animal. Then, so long as they telling the whole truth, they say that the Humans did not come until the Elves and Dragons did - the Goblins did not know them in the Time before Time.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Humans reproduce sexually. They become adults at twenty-five, but can begin to work as early as sixteen. Generally, Humans live to be about fifty, though through intense care the lifespan could reach nearly one hundred years.
