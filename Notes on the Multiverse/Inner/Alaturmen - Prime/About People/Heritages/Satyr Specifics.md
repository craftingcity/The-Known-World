## Legends from beyond the Material Plane
Satyr are one of the few members of the Feywild that came alongside the Elves on their first Walk to Alaturmen. They are few and far between on this plane, and most dedicate their lives to telling the tales of one subject. 

## Reproduction and Beyond
Satyr have no reproductive organs, and reproduce asexually in a similar manner to Gnomes. When a subject is created and the Weavers of Fate take notice, a Satyr is born and tasked with following their story. Satyr have a lifespan of roughly one hundred years. If a Satyr would die before their assigned story is completed, another Satyr is born to the first and tasked with the same subject.
