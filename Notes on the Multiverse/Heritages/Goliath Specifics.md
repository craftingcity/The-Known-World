## Legends from the Dwarves
The tales of the first Goliath speak of a great dwarven feast interrupted by tribe of large stone-skinned warriors lost, hungry, and cold, but only to the touch.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Goliath share the traditional sexual organs of humanoids and conceive children in multiples of twins - one pair, two pair, and so-on.

Traditional goliath culture values a warrior for their ability, not their body. Most goliath agree with the Dwarven concept of gender and sexuality - bond over body.

Goliath live for roughly eighty years. Traditional Goliath culture suggests that a goliath powerful enough passes to an arena beyond time - those who are not worthy are cast down into Alaturmen, and once again cursed with mortality.
