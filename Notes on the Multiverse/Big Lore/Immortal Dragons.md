# Immortal Dragons
## History

The Immortal Dragons are a prehistoric conclave of each color of dragon; the five metallic, five chromatic, and [[Tetrimoc]].

Each and every Draconic being in the multiverse can trace their ancestry to one of the 11 Immortal Dragons if they could look search enough.

## Governance
### Five Metallic
In pre-history, the Metallic forms of the Immortals abandoned the [[Abyss]] for the more logical and realistic plane of [[Mechanis]]. 

### Five Chromatic
In pre-history, the Chromatic forms of the Immortals abandoned the [[Abyss]] for the more exciting and joyous plane of [[Elysium]].
