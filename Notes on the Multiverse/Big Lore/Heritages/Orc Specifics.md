## Legends from Beyond the Material Plane
> For as long as the Multiverse has been, Orcs have been the slave-race of many masters. The Orcs who now reside in Alaturmen were brought by the Giant Descentors during their invasion in The Age of Beginning, the group known as [[Macht's Orcs]].

Orcs are descendant from [[Demogorgon]], and have been the workhorse of the multiverse since the Time Before Time.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Orcs reproduce ritually; they are born from the boiled and Woven flesh of another. While any Orc could donate their flesh to become a child, much rarer are Orcs who possess the ability to manipulate the Weave to create another.

An Orc lives for about forty years, and often begin to work hard labor as early as eight.
