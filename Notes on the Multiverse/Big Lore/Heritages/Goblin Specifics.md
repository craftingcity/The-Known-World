## Legends from beyond the Material Plane
> Tales of "the first goblin" do not exist, goblins have been anywhere and everywhere for as long as anything has been able to think and likely long before then.

Goblin are descendant from [[Demogorgon]] and as a species is extremely old. The tales about swimming in the soup of reality could be reasonably considered true.

## Reproduction and Beyond
Goblins are reproduce sexually, and generally have children in litters. A goblin's childhood entirely depends on where they grew up. Many goblins are able to happily survive in the wild, using their claws, teeth, eyes, and other abilities to their advantage. These same features get goblin children bullied in some "civilized" spaces and highly valued in others.

Goblins live for about thirty-five years, reaching adulthood at twelve. Traditionally, goblins are raised for "the honorable death", but such a concept is clearly subjective, and as such is interpreted differently by many goblin cultures.

### Subspecies
#### "True" / Minor Goblin
"True" Goblins are short and gangly. They are extremely dexterous, moving with cat-like swiftness. Those Goblin that live in the wilds of Alaturmen rely on their peers and preternatural advantages for survival. 

#### Bugbear / Major Goblin
Bugbear are the largest subspecies of goblin and the most "animalistic". Few live in "civilized" areas, but gather together to form bands in the "wild" with other goblin subspecies. Wild bugbear use their long limbs and strong arms to defend themselves and their bands in the wild, and those bugbear that live in civilized spaces are valued for these traits as laborers.

#### Hobgoblin / Middle Goblin
Hobgoblins are the middlest subspecies of goblin, and from the human perspective, the most like us. They have no preternatural strength or dexterity; apart from their natural sharp claws and teeth, the hobgoblin depend on the same technology to thrive as humanity do. 

> ##### Blood-Hobgoblin Clans
> A large population of the Hobgoblins on [[Alaturmen]] have betrayed their heritage-kin, the goblins and bugbear, and formed the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clans]]. 
> Because of the crimes of their cousins, those hobgoblin that do not live for the blood-clans are typically treated horribly by their band-mates.
