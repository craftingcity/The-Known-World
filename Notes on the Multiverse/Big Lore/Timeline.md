# Grand [Timeline](https://github.com/George-debug/obsidian-timeline)

## The Time Before Time
- Beings of this period cannot be destroyed; only replaced, changed, or banished.
- Though the Time Before Time is numerically logged and charted, I, the writer of this setting, am a being who experiences time; the beings of the Time Before Time don't. Like, they still don't. Never will.

title: Three Fates Weave
content:

Three beings beyond undestanding create the Weave, the fabric of reality. 

To begin the tapestry of time, these beings created Titans; they crafted the [[Jabbawok]], molded the [[All-Father Annam]], and forged [[Asmodeus]] - and the remants cobbled themselves together into the [[Demogorgon]].

date: 85xxxTBT
title: Annam rips, tears, sews - creates.
content:

Using his own form, [[All-Father Annam]] began to create more than consiousness. More than reality; physicaility. Earth, Fire, Air, Water. In a ring, Annam creates the [[Elemental Planes]]. Around it forms the [[Astral Sea]]; consiousness made material. These planes birthed many beings, including the [[Immortal Dragons]].

date: 76xxxTBT
title: [[All-Father Annam]] and [[Asmodeus]] strike a deal.
content:

The [[All-Father Annam]] builds the [[Nine Hells of Baator]] for [[Asmodeus]]. He was quick to realize his mistake, though he could not take it back - [[Asmodeus]] would not accept going back on a contract, and was feeding on the Faith-strength of the Souls he attracted to his [[Nine Hells of Baator|Hells]].

Striken with grief, [[All-Father Annam]] built [[Mechanis]] and [[Elysium]], the planes of Law and Good, and he built them high in the multiverse, so far that none of his family could reach - spare his parents. There, Souls collected and formed as Angels and Lictus, bastions-near-immortal of Good and Law.

When the [[Immortal Dragons]] came to him and asked for a plane of their own, for they grow tired of sharing with the other Titans, he said, 'Of course, my friends', and he crafted for them [[Abyss]] and chuckled to himself.

date: 55xxxTBT

content:

As it's consigliere, the [[Queen of Swords]] advised [[Jabbawok]] in a private manner. Moments later, [[Jabbawok]] exiled the [[Queen of Swords]] from the [[Feywild]].

The [[All-Father Annam]] saw this as a disgrace. He spoke with the [[Queen of Swords]] and asked if there was anything that could be done to right the wrong his sibling had committed. The Queen requested [[Limbo]], and when Annam accepted, he did not see the glint deep beneath the Queen's dark eyes.

date: 12xxxTBT
title: Demons fight Devils. The [[Blood Wars of Fiends]] begins.
content:

Evil and Chaos boil and bubble against one another in the "lower" Planes, and blood feuds soon turn to all out war. Matched equally and eternally, this conflict rages beyond a mortal concept of time.

date: 00010TBT
title: Eladrin birth the Elves.
content:
Down the chain of command in the [[Ceilie Courts]], the opportunity came forth to participate in a task decreed essential by [[Jabbawok]].

Many Eladrin jumped upon the opportunity, and formed a new kind, the Elves. For ten years they raised them, and promised them a new land.

date: 00000TBT~AF
title: [[All-Father Annam]] and [[Tetrimoc]] battle to the death.
content:

The contention between the All-Father and the Immortal Dragons became too much. War broke, and throughout the Planes, the Immortal Dragons flocked to [[The Tower of Limbo]], above which, they challanged [[All-Father Annam]] to a seiries of duels. 

After years of battle, as immovable objects met unstoppable force, all the Immortal Dragons but [[Tetrimoc]] fell to the [[All-Father Annam]]. As the final Immortal Dragon took his battle stance, the greatest Titan of the multiverse stumbled. 

Tetrimoc ripped open Annam's chest, breaking his ribcage to it's marrow, rendering his flesh and organs disconnected from his form. In a brilliant death, the [[All-Father Annam]] grasped [[Tetrimoc]] and shoved him into his now-destroyed torso, and expelled all his effort and energy, and died.

At the center of the multiverse, [[Alaturmen]] formed.
