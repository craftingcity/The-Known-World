# The Etymology of Alaturmen and it's Multiverse
## Time Before Time
In the time before Time, the Planes separated and from each sprouted a homogeneous "base" language, from which others have descended and evolved. 

Before and forever after this event, however, the Titans of the Time Before Time communicated in a language known as [[Titan(language)]]. This first primal language is the base from which **all** other language throughout the multiverse has evolved. Rarely, if any at all, since the death of the [[All-Father Annam]] have any words been uttered in [[Titan(language)]]. 

> Explicitly; Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic, Goblin, Infernal, Mechanis, Primordial, and Sylvan all are children languages of [[Titan(language)]].
