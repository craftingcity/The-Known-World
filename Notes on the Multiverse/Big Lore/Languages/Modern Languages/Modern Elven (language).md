Elven is the language spoken by most Elves who live on [[Alaturmen]]. It claims its roots in [[Sylvan (language)]], but it has changed with time and influence from the other people on Alaturmen.

Elven is a slow, beautiful, fluid language that boasts a complex grammar, syntax, and lexicon. 

To form a sentence in Elven, many basic words are strung together to form an emotive or physical concept. This process itself has a complex grammar. After such a concept is formed, it becomes the topic of conversation between two or more communicators, which is then spoken of derivatively for as long syntax of their sentence allows, passing the conversation between the communicators in order of age until all have communicated all they wish. Theoretically, there is no forced ending to a sentence in Elven, but certain syntactic and grammatical rules and patterns begin to corner a speaker into finishing their thoughts. There is no such restriction for written Elven, lending to the stereotype of a long-winded-poet-philosopher's fondness for Elven.
