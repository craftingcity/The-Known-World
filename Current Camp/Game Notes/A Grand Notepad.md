# CURRENT NOTES

I want to make the lore of my world cool and interactive. [[Historical Markings]] on weapons, armor, and other items of importance or value such as coins or paintings are a great idea. #npc characters should make passing remarks about #loreful happenings and characters. Firsthand #text accounts are useful to flesh out these ideas, but cannot be the only way the lore is delivered. Ideally, the story we tell at the table aligns with the story I tell you about this world, and the characters and groups our players interact with should interact with the lore as well. Given that this is a living document, and one that is quite young, we are only at the beginning stages of that idea.

What if [[Kakurak]] died and turned into a lich's pet?

Blood of [[Travis]]; "Blood of a brother..."

# NEXT SESSION

Okay. So none of that happened. See [[Prenotes Dec 11]]
