### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were in the city of [[Boneborn]], doing their part in helping to prepare for the upcoming [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] by investigating its relationship to [[Coraline Avaati]], aka Mommy, and the greater Infernal Cults.

As you arrived on the 13th of Resowing, nothing seemed amiss, but as you spent more and more time in town investigating, you came to formalize multiple lists. You have the names of cultists with blades of curved shadow, the companies they work for, and the people they associate with.

It has taken you nearly twenty days to gather the intelligence you have now, a list of guilty names a dozen dozens long. If you have any questions about the cultists, now would be the time to ask them - otherwise, I must put the question to you; what do you do?
