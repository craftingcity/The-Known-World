### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had come to [[Coalition City]] to meet with the White Mage, [[Pirre Tald]], in an attempt to revive your fallen paladin, [[Shu Ameda]]. Without his body, an intense ritual was performed in the Temple of Many by the Suneites, but the attempt was unsuccessful.

With your comrade's death weighing heavy on your mind, you look to the south, towards [[The Golden City]], for more information about the Black Mage. Your estimates agree that you will spend five days of travel on horseback to your destination.

It is the 20th day of Weeding in the 105th year After Tetrimoc's Fall. With the sun cresting into evening, I must ask you; what do you do?
