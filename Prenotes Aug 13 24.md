### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had ascended from a dark place into the assumed safety of their workplace in the Mining Colony. In relative context, the Colony was a safer place for them, for a while. After spending time recovering from the grand climb, the party exited their plot towards the Supply Center for the Colony, only to find that many Plots, including theirs, had been shut down by a quarantine order enforced by the so-called "Trooper Corp". With due fear, the party decided to abandon the roadways and travel towards [[Mountain Hall]] by trekking through the more wild sections of the [[Deakred Range]].

Since their encounter at the Supply Center, they have gathered themselves, and begun their journey towards Mountain Hall. We return to the party as they set their first camp upon the surface of Alaturmen in many days. The party rests a mile from the Supply Center, in a flat valley between large peaks of the mountain. What conversation breaks between our characters as they set camp?

### What does the World Know?
#### Going Home
They are absolutely able to get to MH with one travel watch - so long as they don't get lost, or caught out by trooper hunters.

DC 12 Survival for not getting lost in the range.
DC 14 Stealth for hiding the party's trail from hunters

#### At Mountain Hall
Some changes have taken place. The tensions between the Loyalists and the Liberationists have gotten worse - they are directly claiming neighborhoods of Mountain Hall, leading the Troopers to stay involved with the entire ordeal.

The party has interacted with the following Web Spun Employees;
	- Hobart Youngkeeper, Warehouse Manager (OMG I missed you guys what happened?)
	- Val Dalm, Plot Foreman (fuck me we got canned. and really it's your fault asshole.)
	- Edgars Banchi, Carriage Driver (OMG thank fuck, I missed you and these new guys are asses)

Their allegiance to WSS has been broken, as "the employees have failed to report for duty". They were replaced in operations and formally unemployed by WSS.

#### Web Spun Solutions, Who are you?
Web Spun Solutions is registered as an Independent Mining Company owned by one "Homer Forgekin". As an IMC, they must have a noble sponsor; WSS is sponsored by [[Hanzbrin Franx]].

The Intellect Devourer was an attempt by the Elder Brain under Forgehome to gain progress towards taking Forgehome - which it has succeeded in by tensing the connection between Forgehome and Franx.

##### Homer
Homer is not a real person. The name Homer Forgekin is a direct reference to the true supplier for WSS, [[Forgehome]].

Homer has never been seen, the documents referencing him "simply appeared overnight" - he lives in room 417 of an apartment complex ("Copperrock Apartments") on the outskirts of the city center, and again, has never been seen by any neighbors. His apartment is furnished, but completely unlived within. No food, clothes, or personal items are found. The entire room is covered in a thin dust.

##### Hanzbrin
Hanzbrin is a valued son of the Franx House, and is likely a lead towards the 'Metallics Supplement Group', the members of Franx and Tazalty who are in dealings with members of the Underdark. He spends a majority of his time performing high-level operations at the Filtered Gem Bed and Bar in a private room he has permanently rented as his office. He will rarely deal with things in person, preferring to communicate by mail to his lackeys. 

#### Laush...
Eve's mother, Kaymin "Kay" Laush, has received and replied to Eve's letter;
	"Eve,
	I'm glad to hear from you. Your siblings are well, as is your Father.
	Regarding the Duche, I trust him as far as I can throw him. He is an a'Alden - he is minor, but a noble nonetheless. If he does not get what he wants from you, I am sure that he would make attempts to take it. His leveraging our connection into using you leaves me disgusted. 
	I worked under him while I was still a CPK in [[Bandeer]]. He had goals of becoming more than a pencil-pusher, and now he is. I could not imagine that you would complete his requests and he would grant you the full honor of your actions. He will not leave this be - you must respond to some degree. In any case: be cautious, and be smart. I know you will do good.
	With love,
	Mama Kay"
