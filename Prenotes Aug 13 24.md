### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had ascended from a dark place into the assumed safety of their workplace in the Mining Colony. In relative context, the Colony was a safer place for them, for a while. After spending time recovering from the grand climb, the party exited their plot towards the Supply Center for the Colony, only to find that many Plots, including theirs, had been shut down by a quarantine order enforced by the so-called "Trooper Corp". With due fear, the party decided to abandon the roadways and travel towards [[Mountain Hall]] by trekking through the more wild sections of the [[Deakred Range]].

Since their encounter at the Supply Center, they have gathered themselves, and begun their journey towards Mountain Hall. We return to the party as they set their first camp upon the surface of Alaturmen in many days. The party rests a mile from the Supply Center, in a flat valley between large peaks of the mountain. What conversation breaks between our characters as they set camp?

### What does the World Know?

#### Going Home
They are absolutely able to get to MH with one travel watch - so long as they don't get lost, or caught out by trooper hunters.

DC 12 Survival for not getting lost in the range.
DC 14 Stealth for hiding the party's trail from hunters

#### At Mountain Hall
Some changes have taken place. The tensions between the Loyalists and the Liberationists have gotten worse - they are directly claiming neighborhoods of Mountain Hall, leading the Troopers to stay involved with the entire ordeal.

The party has interacted with the following Web Spun Employees;
	- Hobart Youngkeeper, Warehouse Manager (OMG I missed you guys what happened?)
	- Val Dalm, Plot Foreman (fuck me we got canned. and really it's your fault asshole.)
	- Edgars Banchi, Carriage Driver (OMG thank fuck, I missed you and these new guys are asses)

Their allegiance to WSS has been broken, as "the employees have failed to report for duty". They were replaced in 

#### Web Spun Solutions, Who are you?
Web Spun Solutions is registered as an Independent Mining Company owned by one "Homer Forgekin" 

### What happened?
