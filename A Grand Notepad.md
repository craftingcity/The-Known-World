### Historical Markings
I want to make the lore of my world cool and interactive. Markings on weapons, armor, and other items of importance or value such as coins or paintings are a great idea. #npc characters should make passing remarks about #loreful happenings and characters. Firsthand #text accounts are useful to flesh out these ideas, but cannot be the only way the lore is delivered. Ideally, the story we tell at the table aligns with the story I tell you about this world, and the characters and groups our players interact with should interact with the lore as well. Given that this is a living document, and one that is quite young, we are only at the beginning stages of that idea.

Temples and Shrines to the Gods

In the second century, contention begins to arise as the [[Blood Hobgoblin Clan Pact]] and the [[Nobles of Prosper]] begin to generate animosity. The Nobles want the resources that the Blood Clans have, but neither side really wants a war. The patriarch of [[Noble House a'Valim]] and the matriarch of [[Noble House a'Nyrk]] have a sick love affair and similar goals.

Bag-head bandits.
