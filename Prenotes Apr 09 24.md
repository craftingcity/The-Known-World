# PREINTRO
hey guys sorry about not giving you any information about who Celaena is and how to fight or defeat her, here are some things that you for sure know;
- She has a physical form and has taken significant damage during your conflicts (90hp on first contact).
- She has significant magical abilities, including both high-level spell slots and point-based activatable abilities, like teleporting in darkness and making the dog.
- She is significantly more intelligent and wise than the other demons and horror-kin you've fought - she is a planner, she has information networks, and she has the support of *~someone~* beyond the wildlands. 
- She is a hard and smart fight; she has the home-field advantage in the Combine (mostly), but she will prioritize her survival over her goals. She is your final boss.
- While it is the belief of your characters, you all should know Jerran is not dead, and in fact not even unconscious, but paralyzed. He has seen the interior of the Boneborn Bunker that Celaena now occupies.

### Intro
When last we left our heroes they had faced Celaena for the third time; she came in the night and took your sharpshooter away from you in the dead of night. After finding him gone, you and Alerga gathered information that lead you back into the heart of Boneborn, and into the Bunker that was once the home of the [[Baron Xuiop]], may he rest in peices.

After some conflict, you gathered Jerran and escaped with your lives. The now familiar feeling of teleportation nausea washes over you as you take in your surroundings; you are once again in the Archmage's Tower on the site of the Magius University. Alergra quickly begins to examine Jerran, and begins to cast a spell. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
Jerran is easily revived/resuscitated, but has multiple days of exhaustion.

Alergra has tasked her apprentices with the gathering of information regarding Celaena, Horror-kin, and the outer planes at large.

Rinnee, Vu'oo'lx, and James will give the report they put together, and hopes that they will be getting a good grade for it;
- We hypothesize that Celaena is the niece of Orcus, and is acting as the major influence in Alaturmen for the horror-kin, and she means to conquer Alaturmen for the Abyss.
- Contextually, the full understanding of the Spirit and Soul is not necessary, only that we move beyond Alaturmen when we are done here. There are four major planes to which each Spirit moves, each representing an ideological morality, but the most relevant of these is [[Abyss]]. 
- Within the Abyss, there are regions or counties that are separated but traversable. Each of these regions is controlled by a major Horrorkin who manifests a more specific or personal interpretation of the Abyssal ideology.
	- You already know of [[Orcus]]. It is our understanding that he holds titles in regards to Greed, Gluttony, and Undeath and rules the region of the [[Abyss]] known as [[Thanatos]].
	- There are four others; [[Demogorgon]] of [[Oblivion]], [[Graz'zt]] of [[Hydonga]], [[Baphomet]] of the [[Endless Maze]], and [[Juiblex]] of [[Pandemonium|Nothing]]
- In our understanding of the hierarchy of the [[Abyss]], these five named horrors are the "Lords", and they control their region and subjects with irrefutable authority. Celaena is a direct descendant of [[Graz'zt]], and therefor could be considered in the secondary ruling class - she answers to her family alone. Her use of powerful Weave manipulation supports this theory.
- Given the above, we believe that twofold measures should be taken in regards to the protection of the realm;
	- First, Celaena must be removed. While planar manipulation may be valuable in buying us time, it is our suggestion that her physical form is reduced while on Alaturmen, and stored separately for as much as remains.
	- Secondarily, the planar barrier between Alaturmen and the Outer planes must be defended, strengthened, or otherwise reinforced to halt continued assaults by these threats. Continued research will be necessary in this regard.
- Regarding the generalized vulnerabilities of horror-kin; 
	- Damage via physical force is difficult without the use of enhanced or patched weaponry.
	- Damage via woven evocation is effective, but the effects produced by righteous followers of our Gods is doubly effective.
	- Horrorkin seemingly have significant resistances to fire and poisons, as they have been ineffective during the defense of the Combine.

### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
