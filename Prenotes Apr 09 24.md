# PREINTRO
hey guys sorry about not giving you any information about who Celaena is and how to fight or defeat her, here are some things that you for sure know;
- She has a physical form and has taken significant damage during your conflicts (90hp on first contact).
- She has significant magical abilities, including both high-level spell slots and point-based activatable abilities, like teleporting in darkness and making the dog.
- She is significantly more intelligent and wise than the other demons and horror-kin you've fought - she is a planner, she has information networks, and she has the support of *~someone~* beyond the wildlands. 
- She is a hard and smart fight; she has the home-field advantage in the Combine (mostly), but she will prioritize her survival over her goals. She is your final boss.
- While it is the belief of your characters, you all should know Jerran is not dead, and in fact not even unconscious, but paralyzed. He has seen the interior of the Boneborn Bunker that Celaena now occupies.
### Intro
