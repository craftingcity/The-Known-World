- She has a physical form and has taken significant damage during your conflicts (90hp on first contact).
- She has significant magical abilities, including both high-level spell slots and point-based activatable abilities, like teleporting in darkness and making the dog.
- She is significantly more intelligent and wise than the other demons and horror-kin you've fought - she is a planner, she has information networks, and she has the support of *~someone~* beyond the wildlands.
