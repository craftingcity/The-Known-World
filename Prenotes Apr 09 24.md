# PREINTRO
hey guys sorry about not giving you any information about who Celaena is and how to fight or defeat her, here are some things that you for sure know;
- She has a physical form and has taken significant damage during your conflicts (90hp on first contact).
- She has significant magical abilities, including both high-level spell slots and point-based activatable abilities, like teleporting in darkness and making the dog.
- She is significantly more intelligent and wise than the other demons and horror-kin you've fought - she is a planner, she has information networks, and she has the support of *~someone~* beyond the wildlands. 
- She is a hard and smart fight; she has the home-field advantage in the Combine (mostly), but she will prioritize her survival over her goals. She is your final boss.
- While it is the belief of your characters, you all should know Jerran is not dead, and in fact not even unconscious, but paralyzed. He has seen the interior of the Boneborn Bunker that Celaena now occupies.


### Intro

When last we left our heroes they had faced Celaena for the third time; she came in the night and took your sharpshooter away from you in the dead of night. After finding him gone, you and Alerga gathered information that lead you back into the heart of Boneborn, and into the Bunker that was once the home of the [[Baron Xuiop]], may he rest in peices.

After some conflict, you gathered Jerran and escaped with your lives. The now familiar feeling of teleportation nausea washes over you as you take in your surroundings; you are once again in the Archmage's Tower on the site of the Magius University. Alergra quickly begins to examine Jerran, and begins to cast a spell. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
Alergra has tasked her apprentices with the gathering of information regarding Celaena, Horror-kin, and the outer planes at large.

Rinnee will give the report the Apprentices put together, and hopes that she will be getting a good grade for it;
- Contextually, the full understanding of the Spirit and Soul is not necessary, only that we move beyond Alaturmen when we are done here. There are four major planes to which each Spirit moves, each representing an ideological morality, but the most relevant of these is [[Abyss]]. 
- Within the Abyss, there are regions or counties that are separated but traversable. Each of these regions is controlled by a major Horrorkin. 


### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
