When last we left our heroes, they were working in the Arthurian township of [[Bandeer]], earning the trust of the local authority, Duche Hedwig a'Alden, by investigating an incident of arson. While you failed to reveal a solid motive for the crime, your investigations led you to a drug-dealing gang and a young boy. After attacking the gangsters, you returned to the Duche, where he told you the issue is resolved, and Jonas, the young boy in question, had gone away - a satisfactory ending for the time being.
