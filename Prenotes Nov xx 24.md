### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were working in the Arthurian township of [[Bandeer]], earning the trust of the local authority, Duche Hedwig a'Alden, by investigating an incident of arson. While you failed to reveal a solid motive for the crime, your investigations led you to a drug-dealing gang and a young boy. After attacking the gangsters, you returned to the Duche, where he told you the issue is resolved, and Jonas, the young boy in question, had gone away - a satisfactory ending for the time being.

As agreed, your relative completion of the assigned task has led to more work from the Duche; a personal interest in the mysteries presented by [[The Old|Minyostalma]], the Ancient Empire that never was - specifically, as he recounted, the Duche is interested in the non-magical technology present in the region. You are to be prepared and equipped for the expedition, where you will seek information or examples of this ancient technology, and return to the Duche with your findings.

As you awake in the comfortable beds of the Duche's manor, you gather yourselves in the grand hall, awaiting the word of your current Patron.

### What does the World Know?

The Duche has requisitioned the following equipment at personal expense, and will expect a return on the investment from the party;

	- 1x [[The New War in the Old City; A Minyostalman Account of the Modern Age]]
	- 5x HEFP I
	- 1x ProFinder I
	- 1x EWDD
	- 1x THLAS
	- 10x Isiopara
	- 35x Ambebamol

The party can travel directly to [[The Old|Minyostalma]] over the course of 2 days, arriving the night of the 2nd. Adding stops in [[Actstow Hills]] would add another 2 days, but will likely hold valuable information regarding the specific contents of the region.
