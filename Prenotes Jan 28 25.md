### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had arrived in a small settlement strategically placed between the [[Fungal Forests]] and [[Forgehome]], known as The Town of Post. You spoke with some of the citizenry and discovered two peices of important information; firstly, those pink furred worms with their two little legs are known to these people as 'Iddies', or Intellect Devourers, and they are associated with 'the Illithid', some faction or group you have yet to encounter. Secondly, you should take a Dwarf with you into [[Forgehome]], so say the commoner, or you will likely be refused.

You've lost count of how long you've been down here, but it's been more than a couple of days now. Even if you find no answers or information, the understanding that you might find a warm bed or a whole meal to call your own draws you, however subconsciously, to the conclusion that [[Forgehome]] is where you should want to be. You might need supplies, or a guide, while you're here, but I'll leave that up to you; *what do you do?*

### What does the World Know?
#### Forgehome
- The denizens of Forgehome are not fond of Outlanders, which is anyone who isn't a dwarf from here in their connotation, but certain citizens legally capitalize on this discrimination by marking up goods and services twenty-fold
- A majority of the work in Forgehome is Mining or Metallics Processing - grueling and low-paid work - but the industry is kept alive by the legendary status of Deepreach and it's riches.
	- Sometimes, a couple miners come back weird (see Elderbrain @ Deepreach)
	- Sometimes, a couple miners come back with stories of 'the Illithid'
- Deepreach is located below Forgehome, but no-one really knows how to get down there and back, so we try to go out - not down.
