### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had travelled into the first city they've seen in weeks - [[Forgehome]]. With the assistance of a guard named Tobias, you were granted entrance to the otherwise restricted city, where you met with Tobias' cousin, Minora, who lives and works here.

With a lack of viable job opportunities, you pursue an entrepreneurial spirit, and commit yourself to guarding Minora and some of their associates on a trek deeper than most other miners dare to go, fearing their lives are more and more endangered as they descend below Forgehome.

Minora has graciously allowed you to stay with her and Tobias for now, and has quickly assembled a team of 9 others, excluding Tobias and yourselves, for this expedition. 

> Is there anything you need to do to prepare?

Once you are prepared, and the group is assembled, you exit the city proper, and begin to follow Tobias' direction west, and down. The miners are strapped with equipment, and each carry a two-handed brass-encased personal drill, excepting one, who carries a leather messenger bag instead.

You travel for more than half a day, down and around, through tunnels and caverns, some so small you must crawl through. You encounter some creatures on your way, but none who come close enough to conflict with you, and before the day's end, you arrive at a winding cavern, where each chamber breaks into two others, creating a mild maze of grey stone.

"You smell that? That's Mithril. We'll mine here."

### What does the World Know?
##### Minora's Mining Operation
Minora is mining for Mithril, which should be a big profit. We're getting to where we need to be, mining for a day, and then heading back home. 

```
Foreman (1) - Minora
Porter (1) - Alexandra
Guard (5) - Tobias, Bhodi, Thomas, Marylynn, Roan
Miner (8) - Sivir, Fulton, Marcus, Valerio, Toor, Revari, Pax, Saria

At 8 hours of mining, and 8 miners at 2lb/hr, we make 128lbs of Raw Mithril

150sp/oz * 16oz/lb * 128lb = 307,200sp

Minora is going to cut expenses first, so we'll say 275,000sp. We said we'd do 50%, but they might not actually notice, and we're doing the math to screw them.

Miners get 15k each, leaving 155k. Porter gets 25k, leaving 130k. If we give guards 20k, Minora gets 30k.

Math says we need to say we're making 160k, making the 80k we're giving the party '50%'.
```

All of this is if we actually make it back up.
