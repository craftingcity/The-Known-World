## Every scar has a story...
In our game, our characters experience combat and brutality nearly every day. Combat is always a risk of life and limb, a story of survival and triumph in the most permanent manner. Every fight is a story the survivors tell with their words *and their bodies*. 

The most dire consequences of combat are the **Lingering Injuries** the survivors wear. A character will take a **Lingering Injury** when they...
	- are Critically Hit by any Attack.
	- are reduced to 0 Hit Points.
	- fail a Death Save.
When you take a **Lingering Injury**, you will roll 3d6 and compare the result to the relevant table below. When you do, *record your injury, where on your body it is, and how you got it.* ***Every scar has a story***.

##### Injury Tiers & Magical Healing
More significant injuries require more significant healing. **Lingering Injuries** and Magical Healing are both categorized into *Injury Tiers*. Spells listed in a given *Injury Tiers* resolve one **Lingering Injury** in the same tier or lower. The *Injury Tiers*, in ascending order, are as follows; 'Superficial' (*cure wounds* & *healing word*), 'Major' (*lesser restoration* & *prayer of healing*), and 'Debilitating' (*greater restoration* & *heal*).
