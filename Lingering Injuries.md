## Every scar has a story...
In our game, our characters experience combat and brutality nearly every day. Combat is always a risk of life and limb, a story of survival and triumph in the most permanent manner. Every fight is a story the survivors tell with their words *and their bodies*. 

The most dire consequences of combat are the **Lingering Injuries** the survivors wear. A character will take a **Lingering Injury** when they...
	- are Critically Hit by any Attack.
	- are reduced to 0 Hit Points.
	- fail a Death Save.
When you take a **Lingering Injury**, you will roll 3d6 and compare the result to the relevant table below. When you do, *record your injury, where on your body it is, and how you got it.* ***Every scar has a story***.

### Injury Tiers & Magical Healing
More significant injuries require more significant healing. **Lingering Injuries** and Magical Healing are both categorized into *Injury Tiers*. Spells listed in a given *Injury Tiers* resolve one **Lingering Injury** in the same tier or lower. The *Injury Tiers*, in ascending order, are as follows; Superficial (*cure wounds* & *healing word*), Major (*lesser restoration* & *prayer of healing*), and Debilitating.

##### Superficial
Superficial Injuries can be ignored in the short term, and are typically temporarily resolved by naturally occurring Adrenaline, but must eventually be healed. The following spells resolve Superficial Injuries: *cure wounds*, *mass cure wounds*, *healing word*, and *mass healing word*.

##### Major
Severe Injuries can be ignored at expense, and could become threatening if left unresolved. The following spells resolve Severe Injuries: *lesser restoration* and *prayer of healing*.

##### Debilitating
Debilitating Injuries are the most major Tier, presenting the genuine threat of death if left unresolved or being otherwise difficult to heal. The following spells resolve Debilitating Injuries: *greater restoration*, *heal*, and *mass heal*. Additionally, *power word: heal* resolves 3 **Lasting Injuries**, and *regenerate* or *wish* resolves all **Lasting Injuries**.
