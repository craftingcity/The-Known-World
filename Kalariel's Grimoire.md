### Foreword

This document summarizes the knowledge found within Kalariel's Grimoire. The text itself is written in a combination of [[Ancient Elvish (language)]] and [[Infernal (language)]]. While an incredibly basic understanding can be comprehended if the reader knows one of the two languages, fluency if the written word of both languages is required to fully comprehend the text.

	- First and foremost, this text is a Grimoire, and has documentation on the following spells;
	- There are no documents for the levels 0 through 2.
		- third;

		- fifth;

		- sixth;
			- *create homonculus*
				- a paragraph of nearly incoherent celebration
	- Secondarily, through much insight and translation, steps of a plan begin to take shape - not of Kal's making, but enacting;
		1. Rely on Orcus (Hades/Jupiter/Dis Pater) for protection; see the island Kal's tower is on.
		2. Act on Orcus' wishes; they happen to correspond with positive outcomes during my time here and further my goals of immortality
		3. Become a faithful servant, and begin creating a reasonable path into Alaturmen, aka, the Corpsemeat;
			- from here one out, the rambling takes more and more hold
		4. Build the bridge
			- "didnt really work out, kinda too easy for them"
		5. Build the "syringe"
			- "done and dusted, the barrier is weak, like i said"
		6. Tweak dosage
			- "thought it might be too much, but boss loved it, wants to start pushing more - gotta build better capsules"
			- "caps done, but still not dense enough to disperse on contact like we want"
			- "THIS IS FUCKING STUIPID"
			- "his darkness may guide me unholy be thy name"
		1. Take the bridge again
