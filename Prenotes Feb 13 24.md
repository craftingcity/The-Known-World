### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had breached the interior of the horrible White Tower in the small town of [[Kamarios]] in an attempt to make meeting with the Black Mage, [[Qiell Tilemundon]]. You did so, with major losses. Your honorable goons have been turned to ash on the walls, and in return, you procedurally executed Qiell. As he fell to the floor, he extended a wry smile, and suddenly the machines in the chamber activated.

With Qiell's corpse on the floor, green steam bubbles and rises from the tanks surrounding Kalariel. A hiss rings out against the silence, as the chamber opens, and a rotten man steps forth... He raises his arms, and the room is filled with a dank yellow brown gas.
