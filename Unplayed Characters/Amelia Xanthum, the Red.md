Amelia is a young looking human woman with curly black hair and and pale skin. She wears a red robe and a veil. The robe, while stylish, is positioned with the purpose of covering the right third of her body, which is entirely covered in red dragon scales - from her feet to her face. Her left eye is blue and her right is the yellow of a reptile's; thus the veil.

Amelia "the Red" Xanthum was born to the noble House Xanthum. The common folk of (Riverden) spread rumor of the "dragonsblood" that populates the noble line, but most think this fairytale. It is not so. The House Xanthum has born many an adventurer, each of whom draws their strength from their bloodlines {icky}.

Amelia was born to be an adventurer, literally, the cycles were such that we knew that Amelia was destined for this. We knew she was going to have *something*, but it took us a little bit to figure out it was magic. - Academy Rector Jamie (he/him, human)

She is a little more proficient with a blade than most would expect from a spellcaster, as she was trained to be a martial fighter in her youth, and she quickly found a love for fire. She would often play with matches, and to her few friends, she was the local pyromaniac. She found that this often got her in trouble however, and kept her practice mostly private after burning her friend's father's book, she swears it to be an accident; I don't believe her, but maybe I should! After growing some, and not showing immediate success with swordsmanship, her parents sent her to (Bramblefort) Academy, a prestige university. In her first year, she began to grow red scales at the bottom of her right foot. She attempted to keep them secret for as long as she could. She was successful for a long time, during which she had a good schooling, although she again did not show great promise. As the mass of scales kept spreading however, it became harder and harder to hide what she perceived as a horrible curse from her House.
