#### In the Beginning
Amelia "the Red" Xanthum was born to the noble House Xanthum. The common folk of (Riverside) spread rumor of the "dragonsblood" that populates the noble line, but most think this fairytale. It is not so. The House Xanthum has born many an adventurer, each of whom draws their strength from their bloodlines {icky}.

Amelia is a not quite young looking human woman with curly black hair and and pale skin. She wears a black veil and long black fingerless gloves underneath her blood red robe. The robe, while stylish, is intentionally positioned with the purpose of covering the right third of her body, which is entirely covered in red dragon scales - from her feet to her face. Her left eye is blue. Her right is the yellow of a reptile's; thus the veil.

While Amelia is [[#Stats|a little more proficient]] with a blade than most would expect from a spellcaster, as she was trained to be a martial fighter in her youth, but she quickly found a love for fire. She would often play with matches, and to her few friends, she was the local pyromaniac. She found that this often got her in trouble however, and kept her practice mostly private after burning her friend's father's book, she swears it to be an accident; I don't believe her, but maybe I should! 

After growing some, and not showing immediate success with swordsmanship, her parents sent her to (Bramblefort) Academy, a prestige university. In her first year, she began to grow red scales at the bottom of her right foot. She attempted to keep them secret for as long as she could. She was successful for a long time, during which she had a good schooling, although she again did not show great promise. As the mass of scales kept spreading however, it became harder and harder to hide what she perceived as a horrible curse from her House. Soon, the others of the school began to notice, and before too long, Amelia fled the Academy. 

She spent the beginnings of her adult years as a hermit, under the tutelage of a (Master Doo'Ilp), and it was clear that this was something she would not excel at, but was determined to make her work. She spent years with (Master Doo'Ilp) and his teaching was most wise for her young mind, he told her of a great many things secret to the world at large, some of which she would never share.

In her 20th year of age, as perhaps *some* text foretold, the scales spread to their final point. As she awoke upon this day, her eye had turned into the yellow of a reptile, and she had gained the power to control magic. It began as things small, a wave of flame when stoking the (Master's) fire or a meal done up slightly too quick. It was not until (Master Doo'Ilp) began to train her in the little magic he knew that it was truly clear what her life's work would be. She began to flourish, calling forth all manner of spell, though the ones of fire and destruction have always been her favorite. After some time, she set off into the world to seek experience with her magic, from recommendation of (Master Doo'Ilp). He is one of the few people that Amelia holds dear to her heart. 

#### Family
While she is in no great hurry to allow the knowledge of her mortality be known to her parents, her brothers and sisters deserve to know, and she dearly wishes to tell them. She was closest with her older sister (Esmerelda). Although her younger sister (Annibeth) was kind, she never knew how to talk to Amelia about some things, and her success at swordsmanship was a fracture in their relationship. She never paid much mind to her brothers, as they were older than their sisters and often spent days about town, doing their business. I'm pretty sure that they were thieves, but Amelia only knows it as "the brother's business".

#### Experience
Okay. I played her in a oneshot; in summary, she's NE, she does not give people the risk of invested empathy and [[#Stats|does not understand those who do]]. She is a little [[#Stats|neurotic]]. 

The academy was bad for her. That paranoia. She was never safe, she hid her real self as far away as she could. She only ever brought herself closer to Master Doo'Ilp. He was emotionally aware, but had great difficulty being anything more than relaxing to Amelia, she loves him though. He was the only person after she was kinda abandoned by her family to this "high-performing"  school that cared more about what you can do than who you are and she wasn't ready for this path. 

[[#Stats|She has a way with people]]. Some find it charming. Some do not. All of them eventually give her what she needs or she takes it by fire.

She is not the hero of whatever story we are about to tell. Yet.

She holds in her inventory these items:
- Marble Cube - its six faces each bare a grid of nine squares that extends to the four edges of each face. This is Amelia's most precious possession. She would never willingly part with it. As a part of her Master's teaching; she learned of "the single items", those things that we hold so precious for no other reason than that we do and this gives us comfort. 
- Explorer's Pack - a collection of things gifted from her master on her long trip.

Cantrips

1st Level
- Burning Hands  - her fingertips alight in flame. she extends her fingers out from her firsts, and she blasts a wave of fire. (massive fire! her (2nd) favorite!)

2nd Level
- Hold Person (she uses this in combination with her fire bolts to just fuck a single target for multiple rounds)
- Alter Self - her scales shift and meld her into a new person; they always keep her scales and eye however. she has no power over this. (this is sorta her "hulk out fuck off" or "sneaky time trick")
