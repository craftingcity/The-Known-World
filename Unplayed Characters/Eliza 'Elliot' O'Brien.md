I am a pale skinned. I am some 5 feet and change. I have short and curly bright red hair. I have green eyes. My features are soft. The other soldiers call me boyish. 

I am 19, born on the 8th of February 1844. 

My greatest fear
- nothing will change
- i'll be found out.

I grew up in Ireland.  I was not given the luxury of kindness from my parents or brother as I grew up. They would often yell at me for playing sports with the boys or coming home muddy. I remember working the farm from a young age, alongside my brother, father, and grandfather.

My parents scraped together enough money to send me and my brother to America when I was 9 and my brother was 12. They sent us to live with our Uncle, who emigrated some years ago, I was too young to remember the day.

I volunteered at the beginning of the civil war. I did not want my brother to fight alone. I am a Private.

I fell in love. We were together for some time before the war started, in secret of course, and she promised to wait for my return. 

My greatest failure.

The ring I have, the one which I intend to wed Mary with, I took from the corpse of a man I had killed in battle. 

On my person I keep... 
- Mary's gift to me - the small charcoal image she titled "Home" 
- a simple ring
- the equipment given to me when I joined the war (which I assume includes some firearm, ammo, powder, and a uniform)

Around others, I try keep my head down. I'd rather not interact with people unless I have to, unless they're interesting to me for some reason. And even then, I am afraid I may reveal too much about myself, and they will use this to hurt me.

I worked at my Uncle's smithy, mostly as his assistant - moving tools, balancing books, gathering supplies, etc. Rarely he will make attempts to teach me his craft, and I am always eager to learn. This has given me some physical strength as well as the ability to perform simple arithmetic. 

Whenever I had time, I would play ball sports with the men of my city or spend time with Mary. My skill set is formed
