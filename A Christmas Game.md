>> Introduction

Greetings family! 
I send you this email to invite you to play a single session of dungeons and dragons, a one-shot if you will, on our celebration of the winter holidays. I will be preparing for the session based on its interest. If you would like to participate, please let me know by responding to this email or giving me a call or text at 206-550-0420.

>> Optional

Additionally, please come prepared to play with a level (3) character, a writing utensil, and some amount of note-taking paper. Other necessities will be provided.

The setting of the one-shot will be (a generic fantasy-land), and as such, (there will be no restriction on character sourcing or backstory or any such thing).
