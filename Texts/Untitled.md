# The Ballad of Grey Ordeal
### Retold as Oraphic; [[Paulo San Tymiq]]

They were all young wen they met. 

A bar, so the public says, but I dont believe them. 

Waywalket was the first to introduce herself; "a student of the arcane and otherwise"

Eledrathil thought this funny, but during their time together quickly found himself respecting her words.

Tubric, ever the gentleman, was second. He spoke in a voice that was short but he spoke in sentences long. Many words, all of them fruitful, efficient, bulbous, and insightful. 

The talks these three would have over a bottle of spirit; Tubric would always be able to find the center of their words.

Uncomfortably, the elf spoke third. To the others, it was clear he came from a place not here; his features gave that much away, if not for the stench of the forest, clear air on his skin.

He told them his story.
That he was not from here.
That he was alive before this.
That he once had another home.


He asked for help.
That he would go against their wishes.
That he would find a way back home.
That he would see his parents again.

The others agreed. Emphatic. Empathetic?

But they needed cash. Nothing moves without cash, especially the bones of the world.

So they asked the Old Man.

He was happy to oblige; a favor he needed; in exchange - the great treasure of desire.

Done and done - "What would you have us do?"

Some days travel. A long walk.
