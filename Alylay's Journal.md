> [[Balywikin Whitimore|Balywikin]] approached me with a new direction for the House. Disimpose Matron [[Do'gamet Whitimore|Do'gamet]], summon a god, rule Everything, starting with [[Ungaethram]]. We just need some muscle. I'll get [[Runzish Whitimore|Runzish]] in on our deal.

> Do'gamet is no more. Long live the Matron.

> Pieces continue to fall into place like Balywikin says. We still hold. The parts are moving.

> Balywikin didn't predict this. They threw us out for "false idols". Killed most of subjects. Runzish and [[Hag'yillf Whitimore|Hag'yillf]] made sure I got out of the city. I made sure Balywikin didn't. Some others are with us.

> We have found a place to stay. Make our new religion true and pure, blessed be Vhaeraun, fair he be. We need only two more pieces! We have the blood-piece! Only two more!

> Soon he shall come. Soon he shall come. Soon he shall come. Soon he shall come. Soon he shall come. Soon he shall come. Soon he shall come. Soon he shall come. Soon he shall come.

Soon he shall come. =========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
