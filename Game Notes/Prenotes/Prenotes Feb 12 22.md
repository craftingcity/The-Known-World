remember travel rules; any rest = 1 ration / traveler, action based in game - can look to [alexandrian hexcrawl]() as similar - for watches of travel and rest (i like the idea of more crunchy travel, but I dont really like the idea of more crunchy travel).

INTRO

How have you been keeping track of the days down here?

You remember traveling towards the light of the city for a sleep after seeing the duergar patrol and a sleep after that. Three before then is when you first spotted it the light of the city. Another you fought with the metal-capped beasts that came from the ground. Another before you slept in the tunnels, and another before you were with your friend. You haven't seen Bardaux since that morning after the blue-ice insect creature and the drow in the crowd and that [[The Wizard In Blue|wizard in the blue cloak]]
