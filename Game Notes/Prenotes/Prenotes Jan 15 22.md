# Prenotes for Jan XXth

Black, grey, white. This is all the color we can see. A tunnel deep underground. The whistling of wind carries us to a group of four holes in this tunnel. Seemingly naturally formed in the wall of this dark grey stone, pockets. The four of them are not situated evenly, two are nearly stacked atop each-other and the third and fourth have some slope. 

You are all used to hard travel, you have slept upon stone before. This rock is uncooperative. For all your shuffling, there is not a place to lay where you are totally comfortable. Eventually, you fell asleep. You are dreaming now. 

For a moment [[Kursk]], you're back in [[Baskin]] with your band of friends. You're sitting around the table, eating a grand feast in a cramped house. Agwir passes the butter to you: "For your bread! Its good you could be with us Kursk". Another of your friends turns you you and takes the meat dish you pass them: "Yeah! Totally! I'm really glad your'e here."

*This turns from a nice dinner scene to Kursk waking up with a Intellect Devourer trying to eat his head.*


Okay
step back
introduce the underdark some more
get comfortable here

We want to push them deeper: "if the drow took your friend, you need to go down. thats the only way forward here."
[[Amashod]] would know this
[[Varis]] may know this too

Lets build some more "random" stuff until they get to middeep. The Shallows bleed into the middeep well for the most part. Especially the artificial areas.

Name Drops for middeep:

[[Lolth]], Spider Queen

[[Vhaeraun]], Progenitor

Thinking about how many sessions I want to stay in the underdark, 10 maybe. Our first 4 will introduce the threats of the underdark, the next few will likely be a more urban ([[Ungaethram]]) setting before finally interacting with the "dungeon" of [[Whitimore's Last Hold]], which is located in the fungal depths of [[Mulutumi]]. 

I think no matter what direction they push, I will move them into the the "duergar pocket".
