	- [ ] encounters / monsters?
	- [ ] intro / recap?

After a quick stop in the [[Heilich-Muwwoq|duergar city]], the party hired the drow guide [[Gudeliva]] to take them to [[Ungaethram]]. The party is camped a few hundred yards away from the glowing city and banging machinery. 

You have just finished consuming your rations for tonight, your stomachs feel just full enough, when [[Gudeliva]] pulls a dark hidebound journal and opens it to a page in the front third and begins to speak (See [[Gudeliva#The Checklist]]).

## Travel
We are in the heart city of a large lush cavern, it will take four travel days to the edge of this cavern - we should gather as much food as we can - and then nearly two dozen travel days on the safe path, and maybe a handful or two less on the quickest path.

3d20 keep highest
safe = +5
quick = -
