### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had once again traveled across the known world. From the cool foggy city of [[Magius]] to the beating heat of [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]], the party has travelled days upon weeks; it is now the 23rd of Plowing in the 105th year After the Fall of Tetrimoc, and the party is a number of days from their quarry, a temple of legend in the [[Lord's Folly]]. We return to them now, as they doff their red bandannas exiting the savanna supposedly controlled by the Thief Lord, [[Agrandica]].

### What does the World Know?

I know i havent been prepping as much as i want

were a number of miles away, we're gonna start with a "find the temple"
then we go to the temple, which might be it's own encounter, as they explore we can run some more, then we wanna go for a kinda gotcha where [[Qiell Tilemundon]] summons some shit to try to kill them after they get in here

### What happened?

we'll see!

they killed some wurms
