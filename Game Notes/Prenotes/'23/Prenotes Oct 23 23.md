### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had gathered companions for an attempt at breaching the inner sanctum of the Green Spring Druid's one known base of operations. While your attempt was successful, you faced minimal resistance - so minimal, in fact, that once you breached the perimeter you were faced with the youngest of these druids.

Leaving the children unharmed, you gathered information and valuables around the underground settlement. You decided that you would not volunteer the payment you said you would, and in presumptuous action, you attacked your hired adventures - and were victorious. There was only one survivor other than the children here today - [[Nylan Roul]], and he will not easily forget what you have done to him. 

You quickly returned to [[Boneborn]] in an attempt to find him or a hideout, but after hours of travel, you feel confident that you will not simply bump into the man, especially given the massive population boom you return to.

The city is bustling in preparations for the [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] which will happen tomorrow. Now that you are safe, and with the information you have before you, I must put the question to you; what do you do?
