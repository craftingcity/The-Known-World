### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they had arrived into the massive capital city of the world; [[Coalition City]]. On their travels into town, they have observed many perils. Issues involving a mysterious hum, unexplained by the [[Guild of Wizards]] and affecting perhaps every Bard in the lands. A perhaps related "black blood curse" that while first was effecting specifically Gnolls, seems to have spread or mutated to affect other humanoids as well.

The sun is high in the sky on this day, the 4th of Plowing, though the spring rains calmly fall upon the streets of the city. 

### What does the World Know?

DEMON CULTS!!!
- Vix knows Infernal? 'The words are written such that everything reads reasonably in Arthurian, but the pronunciation sounds precisely like the word for "power-gathering"'

wanna do a fight today
