### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were still wandering this grey terrible plane. After many battles with ape-beasts and horror-kin alike, the four of you have found direction in this place; a glowing purple light high in the sky, far from where you first came into here. 

You have travelled for days to be where you are now. Standing at the edge of this stone-tree forest, you look upon a tall tower, solid and windowless, surrounded by a small village completely devoid of visible life. Atop the tower, the purple light flashes down intermittently - similar in timing to a lighthouse :)

The singular identifiable obstacle between you and your quarry is a dark black river, only some 8 feet across, it flows from horizon to horizon.

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

We're running [[Kalariel's Tower]].

### What happened?
