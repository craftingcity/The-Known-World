### Intro

When last we left our heroes, the world believed that they were spending an unusual amount of time in their room at the Silver Unicorn Inn here in the Wheel Ward of [[Coalition City]]. 

We know, however, that they were not truly within that room. Perhaps conceptually, and it was true that they would return to the world from this place, but in reality, they were all within a bag. A bag of many rooms. Inside this bag, the Hatdroppers were as safe as they could be. 

Inside this bag, three supposed demonic cultists were restrained and contained. The party interrogated, tortured, and eventually killed the two true cultists - they were of no more use and their continued animation presented a genuine threat - but have spared the one survivor, and have likely turned this pious man's life around (or at least could, once they've released him).

Havar Thourin spoke about a conversation he overheard about a gathering in the city of [[Boneborn]]. Under the context, you can only assume that there will be a gathering of cultists here, if not a meeting of the more formal organizers of this perversion of Faith.

Upon the morning of the Second, I put the question to you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

Taking a riverboat typically costs 2 silver per crate/barrel or 3 silver per person per day. Breenabell will be able to get a free ride if she really wants it.

### What happened?

They called Alergra, and she said the [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] was likely the event that "Mommy" was speaking on - where some sort of meeting was to be held.

Jerran buys a Chiton Studded Leather armor suit from [[Qipaal Cork]]. (13 + DEX / 11 SR)

They are taking 'The Embargo', Captained by [[Revari Madrid]] of the [[Northstone Family Trading Company]]. They want him to take them all the way, and they are a party of 4. 252sp to [[Zalfari]], and another 360sp from [[Zalfari]] to [[Bannerburn]], total of 612sp, but Breenabell does Breenabell and gets 50% off.

The party will arrive in [[Bannerburn]] on the 23rd of Resowing.
