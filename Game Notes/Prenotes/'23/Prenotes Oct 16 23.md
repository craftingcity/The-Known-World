### Intro

When last we left our heroes, disaster struck; a scream rang out in the deep and a member of the party was killed. The survivors have taken a stand against their aggressors at the top of the stairs, prepared to defend themselves. 

Tonight, my friends; you are playing the villains. Roll initiative.

### What does the World Know?
##### Warning
**DO NOT NUKE THE PARTY**
They are Level 3; 
Zeldris has 11 AC, 22HP
Eleanor has 11 AC, 7HP
Basil has 14 AC, 12HP

If things become dire, use Zeldris' connection with 'The Great Old One' (currently no canon set, possibly Demogorgon / Under the Underdark / Patron of Need) to *heal* or *protect* the party.

###### Raimrel Maggviar, Spellsword
###### Nylan Roul, Cloak and Dagger
