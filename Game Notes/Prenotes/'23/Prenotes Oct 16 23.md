### Intro

When last we left our heroes, disaster struck; a scream rang out in the deep and a member of the party was killed. The survivors have taken a stand against their aggressors at the top of the stairs, prepared to defend themselves. 

Tonight, my friends; you are playing the villains. Roll initiative.
