### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they met many of the most important spellcasters in [[Central Alaturmen]], the [[Guild of Wizards#Council of Mages]]. They found them lacking - in foresight, intelligence, or general wisdom - but nevertheless found their connections useful; they were met with the only being to ever return from a trip beyond [[Alaturmen]] - [[Eladrithal Greystone]], the famed Eladrin ranger of [[The Grey Ordeal]]. 

As the meeting disperses, and four of the five mages teleport away with a wave of their staves, the Blue Mage steps from its circle and walks between you all towards the exit back into the foyer of this room. Eladrithal, looking annoyed but compliant, follows the Mage out of the room.

As you leave the room to follow, the receptionist you met before - he who was mind-wiped - he presents you with papers to sign.

<"give them the papers">

If they agree - which they likely should - they will be granted the following equipment upon the marrow;

```
# GRADE THREE PARTY PACKAGE
- GRADE THREE BAG OF HOLDING
	- This bag can hold up to 300 pounds, and will never weigh more than 6 pounds. It's physical form is immutable, and it cannot be stretched to fit anything larger than one by one foot.
	- Currently, it contains the following...
		- A PARCHMENT
			- This simple yellow parchment reads; "Please find the following items in this package..."
				- The multiples of 6 are for each member of the party.
				- The individual items are for a member of the party.
		- SIX (6) DARK STEEL DAGGERS
			- This dagger is simple, and sharp. The blade, guard, and pommel are made of a dark gray metal. The grip is a material unlike any metal or leather you have felt before - it is *perfectly* smooth. 
			- Mechanically, this is a **+2 dagger**.
		- SIX (6) COPPERHAMMER ADJUSTABLE PROTECTIVE VESTS
			- This vest is made of a thin bronze scale-mail. While the "adjustable" in it's name seems misleading, the largest among you and the smallest find this vest comfortably conforms to you and your form. 
			- Mechanically, this is a **+1 ring of protection**, and does not qualify as armor.
		- SIX (6) EVERLIGHT CANDLES
			- This candle is tall and thin, and made of a green-yellow wax that reminds you of nasal excretion. You may light them as normal, and it will burn the wax at an imperceptible rate, while also projecting a minor abjurative effect around the flame itself. This candle could effectivly stay lit forever - even against fair winds or great times.
		- SIX (6) COPPERHAMMER ADJUSTABLE CHAIN-LENGTHS
			- This length of simple iron chain has two spheres at either end. As you pull and push upon them, you find that the chain enters and exits these two spheres as if they contained it. You could adjust this chain length to nearly any size you could imagine, within reason.
		- SIX (6) DARKSTEEL BREAKERBARS
			- This length of darksteel is pointed upon both ends to provide a flat surface on both sides. One of the heads is curved, allowing you to apply great leverage with this device.
		- SIX (6) LASTING FLASKS (OF WATER)
			- This dark leather sack is full of water. It does not cease to be full of water, even as you empty it.
		- SIX (6) LASTING FLASKS (OF OIL)
			- This dark leather sack is full of oil. It does not cease to be full of oil, even as you empty it.
		- SIX (6) S.S.S. PERSONAL SHELTERS
		- EIGHTTEEN (18) JOURNEYMEN GRADE POTIONS OF THE 'HEALING' EFFECT
		- ONE (1) PUGALIST'S RING
		- ONE (1) THE AXE OF GROD, OF BLACKACID, BERSERK
		- ONE (1) COPPERHAMMER BLADE
		- ONE (1) S.S.S. SPELLKITE SHEILD
		- ONE (1) THE BOW OF AMASHOD DENEVILLE, FLAMETOUNGE
		- ONE (1) THE BOLT-BOX OF KURSK, GOLDEN-EYE
