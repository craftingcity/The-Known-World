### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had survived an attack by a patrol of vulture-esq creatures on their way into the one city they know of in this area. For one reason or another, the group has decided to split into two groups of 4 - yourselves, grouping together.

Left without the majority of your magically endowed companions, in a space unknown and unkind, I put the question to you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

A number of hours into travel, the party at large will see a vison of Grande, who performs a quick song for them;

> Giant gorilla eating ghost people, used spell to get through, go around or dont go. Wizards are corrupt, fuck this place, we are leaving, ttyl

Elsewise, we're running [[Thanatos]] as hexcrawl, they are south of the mountain range and north of [[Neranteen, the City of the Fishers]].

try not to kill anyone this time :)

### What happened?
