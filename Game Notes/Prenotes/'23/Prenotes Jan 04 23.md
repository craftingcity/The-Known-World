### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had removed themselves from the [[Temple of Many]] and the detainment of the [[Noble House a'LeQuinn]] guards responding to the slaughter just outside. After speaking with one [[Sir Harris Bly]], they received permission to investigate the occurrence that had brought them all together.

After speaking to the proprietor of the [[Dragons Blood Inn]], Nico, the party elected to acquire rooms within the Inn and rest. The views from your windows clearly show [[Sir Harris Bly]] and his entourage handling the scene; removing corpses, managing crowds, and interviewing witnesses.
