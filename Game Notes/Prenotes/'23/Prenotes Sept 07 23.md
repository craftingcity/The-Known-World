### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had recovered from their inter-planar travel from a small section of the [[Abyss]] back into their homeland. They traveled from the southern beaches of the [[Alvalini River]] northwest into the city of [[New Quillbuck]], where they met with [[Baron Harvord]] and spent the night. 

Harvord shared information regarding another Baron, [[Baron Avory]], who supposedly has a major interest in Daelith, as well as requesting that you "deal" with a group of [[Beasts Righteous]] occupying an outpost nearby.

Upon your decline, the [[Baron Harvord]] simply dismissed you to your personal businesses without further imposition. As you travel quickly away from the disturbing settlement, with the morning sun cresting into the sky, I put the question to you, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

Today is the 26th of Resowing, and I'm looking to the players for major direction; prepare to improv.

Harvord is no shmuck, the party has signed their death-warrant by denying his orders. He'll send out a hunting party to take them out, if he can spare the manpower; if they just dip that should be fine, we'll just keep our eyes and ears out and talk more with [[Baron Avory]] about them.

The party knows about a [[Beasts Righteous]] outpost northwest of [[New Quillbuck]], and though the party may believe them to be "the Kind Natives" vs "the Evil Imperialists", the Beasts are not a kind people - its less public, but they eat meant like meat too.
