### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had arrived in the city of [[Boneborn]], named for it's massive bone-plate walls that keep its citizens safe. The date is currently the 13th of Resowing, and you know that the profane festivities of the [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] will occur on the 8th of Weeding. 

With over twenty days until the festivities commence, you have ample time to investigate any connections to the globalized Infernal Cults and or explore the surrounding areas.

You have no authority here. Any investigation you perform will be opposed by the [[Beasts Righteous]]' local enforcement. Your major patron has kindly requested that her name be left off any documentation and out of your mouth. 

For all intents and purposes, you are operating without a lifeline around here. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

Welcome to [[Boneborn]], the [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] is 23 days away. Merchant companies named are legit, individuals are not ~necessarily~.

The whole point of the Bash for the Infernal Cults is to open up a temporary connection to the [[Abyss]], very generically, to summon a large gathering of Demons, including [[Hannah's Demon (Celaena)]]. 

- Fireworks Show will become a bloodbath
	- The companies will move on before the end of the day, leaving only the locals and independents
	- The non-local merchants have significant protection or a cultist's blade
	- The fireworks show is the most popular event of the evening
- A bloodbath will open a portal from the [[Abyss]]
	- Recently the wildlands have been giving things back / acting thinner
	- Blood can act as a inter-planar connector
	- We have drawn the ire of the Demons 

### What happened?

They are playing actors as a band of travelling musicians. Ulfgar is made to be their management, but they are looking for work as apothecary procurers.

They are going basalisk hunting in the southeast of [[Boneborn]], AH26 at the Tree.  We're playing basalisks as medusas

Nala is the lone survivor. Everyone else has been petrified and is moved into the Bag of Many Rooms. We end the session with Nala researching and the Basalisk corpses in the Freezer room too.

Be sure to mark the territory ([[Reugb Marshes#AH26. Basalisk's Acacia Garden]], AH26) as a Basalisk Lair
