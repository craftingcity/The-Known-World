### Intro

When we last left our heroes, it had been a full 48 hours since they had crossed the simple iron spikes marking the border of the known world. Once they had done so, they encountered a singular man, whom they saw disappear. On their second day, their guide, [[Eladrithal Greystone]], departed from them before they encounter a pack of wolves feasting upon a ruined corpse. They have since smoked the meats and furs, and packed the small camp they made.

Ren. It has been over a week since you've been lost. Too far into the desert has turned from wind-scraped dunes to a hilled pine forest. You can spot the smoke of a campfire in the distance. What do you do?
