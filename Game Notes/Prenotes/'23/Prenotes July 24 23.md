### Intro

When last we left our heroes, the Hatdroppers had released the Worldbinding into the custody of [[Alergra Barrowinch]]. Without another immediate and opportune objective, the party looks to the streets of the Moss Ward on the hunt for any agents connected to this larger conspiracy of demonic insurrection. 

We return to them now, a small period of time after their meeting with the Archmage, as they share a bowl of fruit and nuts over a conversation regarding their immediate action. In other words, I put the question to you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

Demon cults in CC come in a few flavors,
	- doesnt know its a cult, (Sune rape cult?)
		- this is your classical religion-based fanaticism gone wrong
	- is a hidden cult
		- another classic, the general secret society of movers and shakers gathering under specific and odd conditions
	- is a "public" cult
		- a less than secret society of fanatics performing obviously harmful deeds

In this case, we're looking towards one of the last two options. In the end, Coalition City serves as a collection point for resources, but not their end destination, which would be on the Outskirts of society. 

### What happened?

we found a cult in the moss ward in a temple of the many
