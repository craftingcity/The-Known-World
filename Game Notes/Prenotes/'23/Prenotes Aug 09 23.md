### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had returned to Alaturmen. Upon waking on the beaches of the Firelight Sea, you chartered passage to Coalition City, where Shu and Dae met with [[Nicolas Talaveem|the Yellow Mage]] and discussed their future endevors. 

Approaching with caution and the intention to actually be paid for your work - especially given the circumstances of your hiring - you revealed only as much information as you needed to secure a meeting with the council as a whole, sometime during the 1st of Weeding, a mere four days away.

A room has been provided to you at the expense of the Guild, in a Silver Unicorn Inn within the Wheel Ward. Is this where you will stay during your time here?

### What does the World Know?

The first is Newmonth, and a large festival will be held. During this festival, a courier will hand out a handbill ([[On the Hum Arcani; Independent Position]]).

### What happened?

They bought a bunch of shit. Moses came back and offered the group 5000 plat for Kal, meeting them at the Statue North of Coalition City; the wizards will offer a smaller coinage, 
	`but more valuable sum?
