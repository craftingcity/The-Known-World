### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had united with newfound and refound allies on their journey to the space beyond Alaturmen. In seeking answers from the Council of Mages regarding the "black blood curse", the party was directed to a mysterious place that they now reside within - this space is dark, the air here is dry and harsh in your throats, and you are - seemingly - without direction in this space. 

### What does the World Know?

Travelling is somewhat difficult, the weather is terror, and random.

We're somewhere in the theoretical north of [[Thanatos]], so the "distant lights" we saw last session were likely [[Kuta'a, the City of Miners]] - the BOP of the Zo'paak, the demon-cult of this area. They control a major keystone in their city, which should be a major point of intrest.

Given that the Zo'paak are gnolls, we should push the Blood Curse stuff here too, I think that the keystone is currently being used as a catalyst for the black-blood curse, and will be built upon to open a permanent gateway into [[Alaturmen]].


### What happened?
