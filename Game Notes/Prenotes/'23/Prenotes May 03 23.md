### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they were in a less than ideal position. In a land they don't know, with rules they do not understand, the party has quested beyond the material plane of [[Alaturmen]] seeking the deity known as [[Orcus]]. 

Since their arrival, they have created a small camp in the mountainside of the space they appeared into, fought two great beasts of hatred, slaying one and surviving the other. After Moses communed with a dark smokey figure, the party moved to explore furthur into the city - with the knowledge that they may encounter more of these creatures - and they were in fact encountered by a vulture-esq humanoid species flying on patrol.

Roll Initiative.

### What does the World Know?

I can pull on Moses because of his [[Marked By the Fire]] connection to [[Dis Pater, Orcus Avatar]].

[[Neranteen, the City of the Fishers]] and [[Kuta'a, the City of Miners]] are holding two avatars, the third of which is being hosted in [[Kalariel's Tower]]. Orcus proper, the actual Faith-born manifestation, sits in the [[Seat of the Dead]], gorging himself on the souls of the chaotic.

I can throw demons and devils at them, although canonically they are all Demons of Chaos rather than Devils of Evil, but the more interesting fauna would be the ghosts (who are now either miners or fishers or like, experiment fuel or just juice for Orcus in the [[Seat of the Dead]]).
