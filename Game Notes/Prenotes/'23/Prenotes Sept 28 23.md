### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had taken to the streets in search of clues that would lead them toward agents of Orcus. After speaking with a few people you believed may have knowledge on the matter, you found yourselves in a Temple dedicated to Tauruin where a particular devotee caught your attentions.

After following him into the back of the temple and reasonably confirming your suspicions, you allowed him to lead you to a ceremony he was to attend. You intervened before this ceramony was able to commence or escalate, and have since detained the three survivors of the encounter in their magical bag of many rooms.

You still have your room here in the Silver Unicorn of the Wheel Ward in [[Coalition City]], and without another direction, I put the question to you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

#### Coraline "Mommy" Avaati
Born and raised in [[Coalition City]] Coraline was raised in a wealthy merchant family. She had very little to worry for, and would spend her youth enjoying her friendships at school. As she grew, she accrewed more social power, and would eventually come to be the leader of her youth outreach group of her Tauruin acolytes.

As she continued to grow into her religious lifestyle, she began to experience lucid dreams in which she would be wielding a great deal of magical power. Most recently, she had a vision of herself and three acolytes butchering and consuming a large pig.

#### Havar "Piggie" Thourin
Havar was the son of a farmer, and has inherited his family farm. He is currently in Coalition City looking to sell his farm to Coraline, but has since been swindled, conned, and convinced into coming with her to become a sacrifice for the new members of Coraline's Cult. 

Theocratic magic and martyrdom would have been coming to him, supposedly, but that illusion has been shattered.

#### John "Acolyte" Humane
John Humane is a power hungry stockbroker. He came to Coraline during a Tauruin service, during which she explained to him her place in Tauruin's plans. He has no issues with taking power from others to gain it; life is zero-sum.

John has been in a stupor of unconsciousness since the fight. He was dreaming of his life - taking what he wanted for his God's joy. 

### What happened?

they interviewed everyone

they killed coraline and john. they got lots of info from piggie; specifically that there will be a big ol Infernal Cult Meeting on the 8th of Weeding in [[Boneborn]].

they take a long rest here in the silver unicorn, and upon the marrow of the 2nd, they will take a riverboat south, landing in [[Bannerburn]] or [[Smoothpost]] before they continue onward to [[Boneborn]]
