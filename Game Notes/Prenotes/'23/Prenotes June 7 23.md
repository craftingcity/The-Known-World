### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had just encountered and attempted to hide from a small wandering troupe of the dark-spindly-spiney demons on their path to a shining purple light. We return to them now as they continue this combat.

### What does the World Know?

[[Kalariel's Tower]] is the lighthouse of this place; a large circular multistory tower with a small unused smattering of hovels around it. 

It's been for fucking ever since he has talked to another living thing; he needs to take notes.
