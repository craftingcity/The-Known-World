### Intro

When last we left our heroes... well. Most of them were dead. A fate all too common across the multiverse. For any ordinary soul, this would be the end of their story as they understand it, an eternity of similarity awaiting them until entropy takes them into nothing. Luckily for us, our heroes are anything but ordinary;

You remember what happened before you were here: the curse, the wizards, the long march north with the Eladrin, the pink, the dark. The split. Daelith torn limb from core. The castle. The incredible indescribable pain that raced through your body, mind, and wholeness of being until you became to be where you are now.

Regaining your perception, you appear to be in one of many small, single-room buildings that are gathered around a large circular tower built of the same stone as every other "construction" you have seen in this place. At the top of this tower, a bright purple light pulses, dousing the area in an intense brightness every few seconds.

There are no other spirits here, or so it seems. No ape-beasts or any tall-sharp-and-ganglies either. At the bottom of the tower, a set of doors stands ajar, though the interior of the tower cannot be seen from here.



### What does the World Know?

It's time for a fucking DUNGEON CRAWL!!!!

[[Kalariel's Tower]] holds a wealth of knowledge about the [[Abyss]], the [[The Planes of Existence|Planes]] at large, and [[Orcus]]. Oh, and yknow, Kalariel himself, who is a powerful necromancer and tactician. Ideally, he will be put or put himself into a position to (somehow) return these ghosts to a corporeal form in their home plane (and his, but). 

fake bodies, reinhabit to leave?
