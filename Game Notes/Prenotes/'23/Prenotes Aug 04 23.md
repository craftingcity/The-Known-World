### Intro

Simply put; this is a story. A story of danger, excitement, and power. Our story focuses on a group of three in particular, each of whom have their own wants, needs,  and history, but who have come together by chance and opportunity.

Today is the 25th of Resowing. The sping air brings a kind warmth to your skin. Each of you have been selected or have volunteered for a position working as temporary reinforcement for a caravan with the [[Ammarin Transportation]] company as they transport goods north into [[Arthur's Prairie]] and [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]. 

### What does the World Know?

6 other guards. 

Lucas, Tabaxi (North Quillbuck)
Emelia, Dwarf (Hillkeep)
Waztraek, Human (Prosper)
Mark Ross, Elf (Summer, Golden City)
Fatic, Orc (Macht)
