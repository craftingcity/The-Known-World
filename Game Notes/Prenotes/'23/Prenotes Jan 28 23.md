### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they had travelled alongside water merchants towards the [[Alvalini River]]] and [[Barthalamule]]. After a conflict involving wild Wurms, the party departed the one surviving water merchant in the small town of [[Abricadabrin]]. After resting, the party attempted to stealthily remove themselves from the town - but were unsuccessful - as they are halted by one [[Qiell Tilemundon]].

### What does the World Know?

theodmere the ferriemen

### What happened?
spoke with Qiell;

named skull as Gail Thomas "interrupted by [[The Grey Ordeal]] before able to contact extraplanar entity", ie Orcus, but I really haven't dropped hints that its actually Orcus yet.

traveled across the [[Alvalini River]], into the [[Gabrin Shrublands]]; resting in a tavern (unnamed) in [[Aeberu]]. they fought off the pirates at z16 before arriving, killing 3/5.
