### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were as far south as any of them have been. The [[Southern Quillbuck Jungle]] has not been a hospitable place, although you have yet to suffer any major loss. Your first stop was in the small "city" of [[New Quillbuck]], where you met [[Baron Harvord]] and promptly regarded him as a potent hostile - although he did not know it. He also mentioned that another Baron had - quite generically - an interest in Daelith. It seemed like it was time to take your leave.

You continued north, attempting to warn a military outpost of an incoming assault to no success on your way toward your choice of a settlement on the coast of the Alvalini. You have spent the night in the so-called "City of Love" [[Amyl Dother]] in an inn of reasonable repute. 

The sun has barely risen above the horizon before you are awoken by the ringing of bells. A set of six deep rings. Church will begin soon. 

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

Today's ingame date is the 27th of Resowing. The Northern Half of the party has gathered transport and is headed into [[Coalition City]] with [[Kalariel]] at this point in the timeline. (IIRC)

### What happened?

Daelith is moving toward [[Baron Avory]] and the rest of the party is willing to follow her.
