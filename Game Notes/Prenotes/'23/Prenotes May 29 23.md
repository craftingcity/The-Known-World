### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were still in the depths of the [[Lord's Folly#AE2. Temple to Hades]], fighting back the deity known as Orcus. After interviewing Gorrik, a cultist of Orcus, they learned that there is an incredibly important artifact here - an iron chain. Their patron, [[Alergra Barrowinch]], gave them dire warning that they should not cross this looped chain. 

We return to them standing at the edge of the "Soul Sludge" pool, which now contains the  decomposing corpse of Gorrik. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

We're still in the [[Lord's Folly#AE2. Temple to Hades]]. We know that they are going to want to search for the chain, so, they will continue to explore until they find it. One of the last few fanatics is trying to unlock one of the doors further into the lowest level of the Temple.
