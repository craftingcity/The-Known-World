### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had stolen horses from the town of [[Amyl Dother]] with the intention of travelling north and then east into the region known as the [[Westlick Mossland]] in search of the Baron Avory, who - for whatever reason - has taken an interest in Daelith.

As we continue northward, I will ask the party to decide who will take the lead, and what the rest of the party will do on the journey.

### What does the World Know?

Introducing two new characters today from the [[Westlick Mossland]] & [[Eastlick Mossland]]s. Party must have an encounter (vs Druids / Clerics), which will likely happen near [[Fourstone]]. 
	(Green Spring / Cult of Blemon's Blessings)
