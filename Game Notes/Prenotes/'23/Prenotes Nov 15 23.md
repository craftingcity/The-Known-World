### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they were brutally disarmed and led into a simple stone chamber within the gates of the [[Wheernat Hillkeep]], of which you saw very little. You now await your hosts, in this chamber with a single window and a single door. 

### What does the World Know?
They are starting in a stone room with one iron grate to the outside and a iron-banded wooden door. There are a force of guards outside in what is known as the "security level", with the rest of the Hillkeep further below.

[[Arrek Bozkin]] is taking the lead with the interrogation, and his second - [[Hoggak Cander-Wheernat]] will be primarily taking notes or asking follow-up questions that Bozkin does not pursue. 

### What happened?

Arrek capitulated to Basil as she name-dropped [[Baron Avory]], and showed off the Inception that she gave to the Clan.

They are gonna figure out what to do in the morning, and they will spend the night in town.
