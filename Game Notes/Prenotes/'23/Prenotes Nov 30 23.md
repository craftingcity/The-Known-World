### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were operating in the city of [[Boneborn]] against the Infernal forces that have been coalescing there. They have collected a significant amount of intelligence regarding the people and companies that are supporting this incursion. 

As we look outside the large white bone plates that make the walls of this city, we look to an empty clearing a dozen feet off the road where you and I know that a demi-plane of connected room-spaces house our party safe and sound. 

We return to them as they exit their personal-demi-plane on the morn of the 7th. Today is the day before the Bash. Tomorrow - at the burst of the first firework you presume - hell will break loose in the city.

### What does the World Know?

As the [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] is tomorrow, today is the last day to prepare for the Bash itself. They light the porters and Garage on fire. They broke back into [[Whiteout Enterprises]] to find it empty of people and information.

### What happened?
They talked with Alegra, and they got more information about the [[Guild of Wizards#Council of Mages]].
