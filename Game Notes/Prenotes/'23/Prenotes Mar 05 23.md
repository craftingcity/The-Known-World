### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had finally returned to the one and only [[Alergra Barrowinch]] of [[Magius]] and delivered unto her the deliveries she had requested. Quickly after exchanging goods and services, she teleported away to other business. Left with the knowledge that she will make attempts on your reputation, and that a further conversation awaits upon your return to her, or hers to you, at her tower-academy [[Magius University]].

Alone in the forest outside [[Amirisson]], with a sack of silver in hand, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

We're on the south-east edge of M22, and [[Alergra Barrowinch]] is learning kinda a lot right now, especially considering the council she was privy to moments after getting her ingredients. 
		- The Hum
			- we knew about it before, and it is concerning, but like i reiterated to these other fools we cant do anything about it????? and we really dont even know what it means??
		- The Scrivin Clan
			- again, we knew about these fucks, and i've been working on fighting them specificially for a long time - the only reason the blood clans do not defeat us is because they focus too much on defeating eachother
		- The Banshee
			- i want to talk to the girls about this because i do NOT know wat that is
		- The Revenants
			- i want to talk to the girls about this because i do NOT know wat that is
		- The Black Mage
			- FUCk queill, this guy is an asshole and he's so creepy
			- i feel like he doesnt actually have boundaries
		- The Boomsticks
			- again, i knew about this, but it's not something thats super on my radar right now considering the worldwide crisis we just dealt with and we're now dealing with
- in conclusion, i'm really interested in speaking with [[The Wizard In Blue]] and [[Pirre Tald]] more about like, what we just did and why we did it and what we're gonna do next
- i think my team, should they agree that they are infact my team, should know that i want to keep the guild and stuff in the dark about them so that i can use them to get around the restrictions that may or may not allow me to make the decisions that i know i'll need to, specifically regarding queill that rank whore

Other than the reactions of the world around them, it really is up to what the party wants to go back and investigate, or where they go next. I can only prepare for what I will use.
