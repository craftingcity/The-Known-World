### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had achieved a feat of great historical note; they performed a heist dozens of years in the making for a planar gate. While they gained a large swath of other items of personal importance, this so-called "Worldbinding" was the quarry of their current patron, and likely many other forces, each of which I could name in order of nefariousity, but alas...

We return to them now; with the trample of hooves being accompanied by an off-key tune, the party travels north-east from the city of [[Kickoff]] and into the [[Deakred Range]], snacking on Wurm jerky upon their path. What do you do?

The date is 02/27/0105 14:00.

### What does the World Know?

[[Alergra Barrowinch]] wants to keep and hide the WB, as well as the group at large ([[Kakurak]] may be a good option, but something like Dimensional Reduction might be a better one, expensive as it would be)
[[Qiell Tilemundon]] wants to take the WB eventually, but is more into the general information. Genuinely confused as to why the party is important, so has been tracking them ("why yall hanging out in the desert so much?? then travelling right back to magius?????")
[[Jorrin Bearscarred]] / [[Nicolas Talaveem]] / [[Baron Cassindil]] are the few notable people who may know/want to know about the return of Moses the Brave (which is fucking WORLD NEWS)

the next like, dramatic steps are probably going to look like finding out more about Worldbindings and or finding more Worldbindings? we know that Moses is going to come out of the WB eventually, and that might have to happen offscreen.

### What happened?

The Hatdroppers bought out a safe deposit box in the Golden Ward of Coalition City for a year, and have their Bag of Holding inside, along with 3000 silver swords, Ulfgar's Old Warhammer, Holy Symbol of Ar'Kraven, and Chainmail.

They headed to The Dew Drop, an Alchemical shop in the Golden Ward, to meet with [[Alergra Barrowinch]].
