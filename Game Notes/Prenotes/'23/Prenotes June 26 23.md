### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had achieved a feat of great historical note; they performed a heist dozens of years in the making for a planar gate. While they gained a large swath of other items of personal importance, this so-called "Worldbinding" was the quarry of their current patron.

We return to them now; with the trample of hooves being accompanied by an off-key tune, the party travels north-east, snacking on Wurm jerky upon their path.

### What does the World Know?

[[Alergra Barrowinch]] wants to keep and hide the WB, as well as the group at large ([[Kakurak]] may be a good option, but something like Dimensional Condension might be a better one)
[[Qiell Tilemundon]] wants to take the WB eventually, but is more into the general information
[[Nicolas Talaveem]] / [[Baron Cassindil]] are the few notable people who may know about the return of Moses the Brave


### What happened?
