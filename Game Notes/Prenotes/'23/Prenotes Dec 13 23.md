### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had organized a show of good faith with the King of Prosper, [[Arthur Simonson]]. They had moved north of the city of [[Gambleum]], to a space between the delta of the Salted River and the [[Illburn Forest]], where they were to meet a field-commander of the Rectio Chapter-House of [[Arthur's Knights]].

### What does the World Know?

3rd Field Commander: Mayon Bradley of Chapter-House Rectio commands 12 squads of 8.



### What happened?

They returned to King Arthur with the head of the Scrivin Clan Leader, who in return offered to sponsor the party (and give them sending stones)

We leave our heroes on the date of the 9th of Weeding, 105 AF, as they return north towards Cenva Minyo and the Actstow Hills for information regarding specific characters they've "tailed" - including Human Gringold, Moses, and other Parties throughout the world.
