### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had finally returned to the one and only [[Alergra Barrowinch]] of [[Magius]] and delivered unto her the deliveries she had requested. Quickly after exchanging goods and services, she teleported away to other business. Left with the knowledge that she will make attempts on your reputation, and that a further conversation awaits upon your return to her, or hers to you, at her tower-academy [[Magius University]].

Alone in the forest outside Amirisson, with a sack of silver in hand, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

We're on the south-east edge of M22, and [[Alergra Barrowinch]] is learning kinda a lot right now, especially considering the council she was privy to moments after getting her ingredients. 
		- The Hum
			- we knew about it before, and it is concerning, but like i reiterated to these other fools we cant do anything about it????? and we really dont even know what it means??
		- The Scrivin Clan
			- again, we knew about these fucks, and i've been working on fighting them specificially for a long time - the only reason the blood clans do not defeat us is because they focus too much on defeating eachother
		- The Banshee
			- i want to talk to the girls about this because i do NOT 
		- The Revenants
		- The Black Mage
		- The Boomsticks
