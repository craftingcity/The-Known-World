### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had returned to civilization after a raid on a druidic holding. During your raid, one of your allies turned victims escaped beyond your grasp. [[Nylan Roul]] will not forget your names or deeds, nor likely will the Green Spring Druids, as their home slowly smolders away in the far distance.

The party has moved on, in search of more answers to their questions. After following your path once travelled, you have arrived in [[Emorin's Plots]] in search of the very thing you delivered here many days before.

With that in mind, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

The [[Ammarin Transportation]] Company warehouse is run by the "Quartermaster Boris Herrach" and his crew.
