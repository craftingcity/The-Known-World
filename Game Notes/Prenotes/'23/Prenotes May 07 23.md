### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had travelled again across the known world, from the major city of [[Magius]] south-west, again, though not into the Golden City but beyond it. Using incomplete information and your survivalist skills, you were able to locate your quarry; a temple built deep within the hills of [[Lord's Folly]]. It is supposed that the purpose of this temple relates somehow to [[Gail Thomas]] and the extraplanar known as [[Orcus]]. 

As the sun rises in the east, alighting the globe atop the Golden City barely visible upon the horizon, you and your idle mounts reawaken. From your camp upon the dunes, you can keep a line of sight to the temple, itself an ugly thing. Built of red sandstone, the building itself is bulbus and pudgy, it's columns overflowing with smooth bulbous rock.

### What does the World Know?

We are entering [[Lord's Folly#AE2. Temple to Hades]]. We have a few different teams in the mix for this dungeon; 

First, the 6 noble thieves. 4 from Cobalt's group (Batii the Calm, Heaver the Dreader, Mol the Restless, Vander the Strong) and 2 from Agrandica's (Gyan the Wracked and Vlal the Honorable) - they are working together for the time being in search of any signs of [[Ranger's Guild]] patrols in the area at the behest of the Guilds and their immediate superiors. They are currently keeping quiet in the bottom of the crypts room, and all of them have some manner of exhaustions. If necessary they will fight or work with the party, whatever will get everyone out as alive as possible (everyone on my team at least).

Second, the fanatics and undeadsiz. We can spread the undead on both the upper floors and some in the lowest, but the ratio of fanatics to undead should increase in favor of fanatics (some) as we keep going lower.

### What happened?

they are exploring the temple, the reliefs generally support the timeline that the cult has been around for a couple dozen years, with specific mentions of 4 main cultists and one Kalariel (who I am thinking maybe was [[Gail Thomas]] retitled?)
