### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they were in the capital of the world, [[Coalition City]], on a hunt for information. They specifically have been on the trail of the so-called "black-blood curse" that affected a group of Gnoll pit-fighters in [[Yerba]], its connection to the "great hum" that magical bards have reported experiencing some weeks ago, and the truth of it's cause and/or effects.

Sadly, they have been able to gather little information - only that the greater powers that be, such as the Guild of Adventures, do not know - or perhaps only refuse to share - any kind of actionable information regarding these incidents. In [[Yerba]], [[Sir Harris Bly]] and [[Toor, of Killskull]] - a Sergeant of [[Arthur's Knights]] and an affected Gnoll pitfighter - await your return, hoping to be briefed with valuable information - that you simply do not have.

What awaits you now, on the grand stone roads of the [[Iron Ward]] of [[Coalition City]], is a field of people who know nothing of you or your deeds and plots. They do not know the danger they calmly walk within. 

What do you do?

1. The Black Blood Curse has been affecting everyone, and today (the {5}th of Plowing), the Council of Mages will be releasing a briefing to the Guilds en General.
