### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they were traveling along a well-maintained cobblestone path, southward, toward the interior of the mountains. [[Coalition City]], the party's goal-apparent for the gathering of information, lies in the center of the massive [[Deakred Range]]. 

The sun is no longer visible behind the massive red mountains. Although it still alights the sky a bright blue, it will begin to dim within the hour. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

I want to give them the Map, because they had asked for one and I said no, like a goober. That looks like a cartographer in peril (the young hobgoblin man Gorsh Ragrinx, son of Burrik Ragrinx, hand of the Standing Watcher [[Arrek Bozkin]] of the [[Wheernat Clan]]), being chased by two of [[Bodaim's Bandits]].

They are probably headed into [[Coalition City]] from the north, so they are coming through the "true" entrance to the city, the [[Iron Ward]]. They can find rumors here from many travellers, and likely can encounter any number of bands or bards.

Should they find this information lacking, they can be reminded about the information of the [[Guild of Adventurers]], found throughout Coalition City, their reception will be fairly static - "you are unregistered, we don't know you... if you scratch our back first, harder, we can get you information about this".

> Why isn't the [[Guild of Adventurers]] already pursuing the issues of the Second Hum?
> They are, but they can't say that to these shmucks. The [[Guild of Wizards]] has approved covert investigation regarding "demon cults", the "black-blood curse" and the names "Hades", "Pluto", and "Dis Pater" - the truer name; "[[Orcus]]" has yet to be re-exposed, and it's true name is still well hidden.
