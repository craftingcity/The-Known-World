### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were on guard with a [[Ammarin Transportation]] Caravan, and were halted by a suspicious growth on the roads. As soon as the group investigated, they were attacked by a group of bandits wielding slings and swords. During the battle, the party suffered minor damage, but after a short burst of combat, they emerged victorious. 

Your driver and the other conscious caravan guards are setting camp here; leaving you three to act with freedom. With that being said, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

Today is the evening of the 26th of Resowing. These bandits come from a circle of "city druids" - the Green Spring Circle - who gained information regarding this particular caravan (and it's contents) from the greater Aquan network. 

The guards dont specifically know what has happened, but would definitely have general information about the world or more specific groups - the party likely will have to come up to them and ask, however.

The driver genuinely doesn't know much of anything about the contents - as Avory would wish it.

The contents of the box is mostly textiles, but hidden within one of the sealed containers is a small artifact known as Inception, which is to be delivered to an Agent in [[Wheernat Hillkeep]].
