### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had taken to the streets in search of clues that would lead them toward agents of Orcus. After speaking with a few people you believed may have knowledge on the matter, you found yourselves in a Temple dedicated to Tauruin where a particular devotee caught your attentions.

After following him into the back of the temple and reasonably confirming your suspicions, you allowed him to lead you to a ceremony he was to attend. You intervened before things escalated, and have since detained the three survivors of the encounter.

### What does the World Know?

As she grew, she accrewed more social power, and wo uld eventually come to be the leader of her youth outreach group of her Tauruin acolytes.

As she continued to grow into her religious lifestyle, she began to experience lucid dreams in which she would be wielding a great deal of magical power. Most recently, she had a vision of herself and three acolytes butchering and consuming a large pig.
