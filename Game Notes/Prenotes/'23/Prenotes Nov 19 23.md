### Intro
When last we left our heroes, the party of Penne, Gringold, Dae-Shim and Shu Ameda had made their way alongside Paulo Equestria to a settlement in the southern [[Actstow Hills]] by the name of [[Yahlin]]. There, they met with a very agreeable Eldare of [[Cenva Minyo]] by the name of [[Raam ben Yarom]]. 

In exchange for involving him in their plans to assault the White Flame directly, Shu explained the reason for his exile from the Church, and [[The Holyl'nds]] at large; He is one of the few living people who has seen the visage of [[Its Greatness]] and survived to tell the tale. He had infiltrated the central chamber of the Grand Chapel in [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln|Kanielkiln]] via one of the many ventilation shafts as a younger man, and that very night was run from the Holy City by a mob led by Spoken [[Abraham the Wise]]. 

Eldare Yarom has sent word to the closest standing armies of [[Cenva Minyo]] to rally to [[Yahlin]], and in the coming days, they will assemble at the western edges of the [[Actstow Hills]], awaiting their orders from on high. Paulo Equestria has been retasked to accompany you as a liaison to [[Cenva Minyo]] as you infiltrate the [[The Church of the White Flame]].

### What does the World Know?

[[Yahlin]] has a population of about 6500 people. Cenva Minyo is fairly Militant, and given minor reasearch, a 2% rate for active members is *high* (higher than U.S.A.). 2% of 6.5k is 130. 6 groups of 20, 1 commander each.

### What happened?

They negotiated with Eldare Yarom, and begin to head to [[Castle Prosper]].
