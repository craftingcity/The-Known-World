### Intro

When last we left our heroes, the party of Penne, Gringold, Dae-Shim and Shu Ameda had made their way alongside Paulo Equestria to a settlement in the southern [[Actstow Hills]] by the name of [[Yahlin]].

There, they met with a very agreeable Eldare of [[Cenva Minyo]] by the name of [[Raam ben Yarom]]. In exchange for involving him in their plans to assault the White Flame directly, Shu explained the reason for his exile from the Church, and [[The Holyl'nds]] at large; He is one of the few living people who has seen the visage of [[Its Greatness]] and survived to tell the tale. 

He had infiltrated the central chamber of the Grand Chapel in [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln|Kanielkiln]] via one of the many ventilation shafts as a younger man, and that very night was run from the Holy City by a mob led by Spoken [[Abraham the Wise]]. 

Eldare Yarom has sent word to the closest standing armies of [[Cenva Minyo]] to rally to [[Yahlin]]
