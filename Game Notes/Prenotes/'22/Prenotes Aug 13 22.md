### Intro
When we last left our heroes, they were in the process of raiding a keep of some kind controlled by the Giant Decenters and [[King Snure]]. The party entered from the large southern egress, and found and freed a number of humanoids who had been enslaved by the giants here. After slaying the offending giantkin, and recruiting one of the enslaved - Mali-kana, of [[Macht's Brood]], the party continued to explore the keep and found the Lady In White, [[Alylay Whitimore]], Matron of the Whitimore Drow and her two Concubines who barely escaped your grasp in the Underdark. You killed them here, but not before they took the life of Mali-kana in a deadly gas cloud.

We return to our heroes now, in this keep, in the final resting place of the Whitimores. 

The room is drab, the walls noticeably bare other than the shelves, which too now lay bare, which are pushed against the wall. A large four-post bed stands alone on the other side of the room, bearing the only colors in the room on the mixed mass of pillows and blankets overflowing from the bed onto the floor. 

I will remind Amashod that Varis' *cone of cold* revealed a thin slit in the southern wall, about 8 feet or so away from the bookshelf.

### What does the World Know?
We're still in [[Giant's Toe]].

### What happened?
Party rested for 4 hours. after finding Bardaux. They used Planeshift to teleport him back to Kakurak's Lair. Afterwords, they moved to attempt to continue clearing the keep, but to their surprise, the giant's had repopulated what they had cleared 4 hours before, grod and gudliva rushed into the workshop, beginning combat: see notebook.
