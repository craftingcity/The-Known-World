### Intro

When last we left our heroes, the sun shone brightly over the city of Yerba. Under a kind sky, these people - and, in some sense, the city - before us were assaulted. A group of fighters exiting the [[Dragons Blood Inn]] began to slaughter indiscriminately as a crowd momentarily formed in the street. After less than a half-minute, this group had fallen to an unassembled, makeshift band of do-well defenders - our heroes.

Only moments more come to pass before the screams of the crowd dispersing are drowned by the thudding of heavy boots and the jingling of chainmail as guards bearing the bulls-head crest of the [[Noble House a'LeQuinn]] round the corners upon the scene.

"Disarm yourselves! Lay down your weapons and come peaceably!"

### What does the World Know?

Todays in-game date is 1st of Plowing, 105AF

#### Encountering the Guard
[[Sir Harris Bly]] of the [[Noble House a'LeQuinn]] is the highest ranking member of the guard on scene, and he is gonna do his damndest to get justice for the fallen here today. He has a dozen trained guard at his disposal, but violence is not the answer to violence. 

#### The Scene of the Crime

#### Other Activity in the City
Our heroes are the main characters of this story, but not it's setting.

1. The Guild of Wizards has yet to issue a decree on the "Great Hum" of the last week.
