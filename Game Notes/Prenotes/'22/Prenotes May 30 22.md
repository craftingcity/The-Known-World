	- [ ] intro / recap?


I have the encounter prep in paper somewhere.

I talked with Grandpa to see about his two characters, he said if given the option, he would continue to play Kursk, I suggested that this means Bardaux is my NPC now - he seemed ammicable and accepted this.

[[Alylay Whitimore]] carries [[Alylay's Journal]] and the Alliance contract in the shelves in the [[Whitimore's Last Hold]].

#### During Game
The Whitimores escaped via their plans; the Concubines, Alylay, all the Archers, and the prisoners escaped into the Plane of Fire and Snure's Keep.

The party gathered [[Alylay's Journal]] and the Alliance Contract between the Whitimore and the Giants.

For the most part, they're on the right track for solving the mystery, though after asking both [[Amashod]] and [[Varis]]'s players they believe .

After the fight against the Whitimores, they received more information from the Atriarch of [[Ootool]], specifically regarding Vhaeraun.
