# Prenotes for May 30th
- [ ] DM Screen
- [ ] Notepaper
- [ ] Prep
	- [ ] maps?
	- [ ] encounters / monsters?
	- [ ] intro / recap?


I have the encounter prep in paper somewhere.

I talked with Grandpa Jim to see about his two characters, he said if given the option, he would continue to play Kursk, I suggested that this means Bardaux is my NPC now - he seemed ammicable and accepted this.

The Whitimores need Varis alive, for his Soul, Bardaux and Travis are not necessarily needed, though they are useful for their Blood and Body.
