### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were in the city of [[Ootool]], having removed the Whitimores from their previous holding. During this escape, the collective of drow left behind a number of important items. A contract decreeing an Alliance between the Matron of the House Whitimore and King Snure, a name you have heard before from the [[Jarl Grungar]] as the Giant he answers to on this planar assault. A diary, describing bits and pieces of the truth of the Whitimore's plans, something about pieces... And finally, and perhaps most perplexingly, an enchanted black chain, similar to one you found in the treasury of the Hill Giants and returned to [[Kakurak]] for greater inspection.

With full bellies, an ally at your side, and the fate of the world you call home in your hands, I ***bequeath*** you! What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
[[Jarl Grungar]] agreed to resend involvement in [[The Assault of the Giant Decenters]].

[[Kakurak]] wishes to get in contact with the party to recall them at their earliest convenience to compare information. He can do this by harnessing some of the power of [[Its Greatness]], one of the few beings known to be intra-planar in nature and willing to Deal.

- the black chain uses fey magic to travel the planes
- the ice giants accepted our terms, backed out and are planning on standing their ground against any who would oppose them, including Snure
- the nations of Coalition have agreed to return assault, are already too slow, the Giants are here and the Church is losing ground.

[[King Snure]] is on Alaturmen in his Keep of Magma, and his Son is working on the War Machine in the workshops of his home. Many hill giants, fire giants, and few stone and ice giants have joined him from around the elemental planes to invade. Air and Storm giants who directly opposed this found themselves losing an unfair fight, and then bound and willed to become weapon for Snure and his Free Giants.

[[The Whitimores]] fled to King Snure's Magma Keep. There, they were greeted with honors. After [[Alylay Whitimore]] explained the situation, that the remnants of the Whitimore House had been sundered by this group of adventurers they were tasked with destroying, [[King Snure]] imprisoned them for their failures, citing the clause of their contract that states usefulness.

### What happened this session?
Well, not a ton. I had forgotten they had to leave the Underdark, so they fought through the Grazing Fields and left via the Pit to the Growth Heart that surfaces in the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clans]]. At the end of the session, the Party had made their way into Kakurak's Lair, Kakurak landing behind them moments later, proclaiming there was much to discuss.

Almost nothing needs to be changed to be able to run this for next week.
