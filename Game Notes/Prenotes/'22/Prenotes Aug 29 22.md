# PREGAME RULES ANNOUNCEMENT
watch types

active v rest v travel

### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had just set camp in the foothills of the [[Deakred Range]], a Watch's travel to the [[Iron Ward]] of [[Coalition City]]. The yellow sun of the day is beginning to set to a bright orange, and it will not be long until the orange turns dim, and the dusk of the moon supplants the day's sky.

I have a few questions; 
	- What does camp look like?
	- Who's doing what?

### What does the World Know?
