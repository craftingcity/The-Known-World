### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had finally arrived at [[The Golden City]]. The massive Golden Globe shining above them, the party found need to separate; their horses. For whatever reason, the members of the [[Golden Claws]] arming this transportation device into the core of the city would not allow your mounts to join you on the descent. Instead of electing to slaughter and dress their exhausted mounts, Jerran and Ulfgar have gathered them and departed in search of a place of rest, leaving Nala and Breenabell to enter Inner Core of the Golden City.

### What does the World Know?

Inner Squad is on the hunt for Dr Gunagido, Outer Squad is on the hunt for a place to rest and maybe some information or something?

In any case, we should district out the city.
