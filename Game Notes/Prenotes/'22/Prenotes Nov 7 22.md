### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had finally arrived at [[The Golden City]]. With the massive Golden Globe shining above them, the party found a need to separate; their horses. For whatever reason, the members of the [[Golden Claws]] arming this transportation device into the center of the city would not allow your mounts to join you on the descent. Instead of electing to slaughter and dress your exhausted mounts, Jerran and Ulfgar have gathered them and departed in search of a place of rest, leaving Nala and Breenabell to enter Inner Ring of the Golden City.

With a clang and a groan, the metal capsule shakes and begins to move. Through dirty glass windows, you can see your companions as they begin to descend into the massive central cored chasm.

Everyone roll a d20, and add yours with your partner's. Whoever gets the higher total plays their game first.

	((FOR NALA & BRENA))

	((FOR ULFGAR & JERRAN))

### What does the World Know?

Inner Squad is on the hunt for Dr Gunagido, Outer Squad is on the hunt for a place to rest and maybe some information or something?

In any case, we should district out the city.
