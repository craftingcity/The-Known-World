- [ ] Prep
	- [ ] maps?
	- [ ] encounters / monsters?
	- [ ] intro / recap?

It has been 10 sleeps since you have seen the daylight. You four and your guide, [[Gudeliva]], sick as they are, recently fought a magical spider and took in its three live victims; Krenzo, Wyruq, and Blug. 

[[Gudeliva]] reassures the party that they will reach [[Ootool]] soon. Another day or two of travel along the Kingsroad and then one more to reach [[Ootool]]. There they can leave the three unknowns and rest. They'll continue the journey when they recover (which would be four days after the two it takes to get to [[Ootool]] - the first day in [[Ootool]] will be the most painful).
