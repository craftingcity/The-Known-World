The characters have been hired from somewhere, maybe the adventurers guild to work for [[Alergra Barrowinch]] to gather materials for her newest experiments.

Comes with 500sp signup for expenses, and ~750 on quality and timely delivery.

Need glass from an expert blower in [[Yerba]], gems cut from the [[Darnt Hillkeep]], and alchemical components gathered in [[The Golden City]].

# Postnotes
The party of [[Breenabelle]], [[Jarren]] & Pip, [[Ulfgar]], [[Nala]] & ('lil fucker) accepted Alegra's quest by contract. They talked with a local alchemist to gather some more information. Then, after coming back to the Silver Unicorn to drink, Jarren started a bar fight with six drunk farmers.
