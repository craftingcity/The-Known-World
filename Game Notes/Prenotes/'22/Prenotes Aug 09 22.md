### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had survived a raid on Yerba by the Scrivin clan, and retrieved their first of three special packages for the [[Alergra Barrowinch|Grand Archmage of Magius, Alergra Barrowinch]]. They experienced minor losses, Ulfgar going unconcious, but escaped just as the waves of the House a'LeQuinn guard turned the tide of the Battle for the Square. We return to them now, only an hour or less since our last session, resting in the [[Dragons Blood Inn]]. What does that look like?

### What does the World Know?
- [[Barret Bodaim]]'s Bandits
			- Barret "the Brains" Bodaim / CR 5 Legendary Soldier
				- melee weapon attack (1)
				- ally attack (1)
				- melee slow + 1/2 damage attack
			- "Skinny" Pete Yuuwbin / CR 3 Skirmisher
			- Jimmy "No-Bugs" Cammir / CR 3 Artillery
			- Penny "Big-Time" San-Tymiq / CR 3 Brute
			- Wanda "Gonna'Gettcha" Bund / CR 3 Soldier
			- Fern "Doesnt-want-a-nickname" Cinnamon / CR 4 Controller
			- Jak / CR 1/8 Child

It's likely that the party will attempt to continue their work for [[Alergra Barrowinch]], and travel to the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] & further to [[The Golden City]] to do so, if they are able to do so.

### Darnt Hillkeep

[[Baron Jammu]] is awaiting the arrival of the misfits, and will collect a day of rent from them if they stay the night in her territory.

### The Golden City

[[Doctor Gunagido]] is currently deep within the City, in a [[Golden Claws]]' laboratory. He has left his personal laboratory in statis-quo with his journeymen, telling them that he would only be able to return to them after his very important work had been completed, and that he does not know how long such a task will take, but to expect a communication from him before a week. They received a very generic letter from the High Ambassador [[Venclaw]] and have since ceased investigation.

### De-railed
We have encounters prepped, and tables & hexes for otherwise. 

### What happened?
