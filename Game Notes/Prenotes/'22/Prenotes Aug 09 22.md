### Intro


### What does the World Know?
- [[Barret Bodaim]]'s Bandits
			- Barret "the Brains" Bodaim / CR 5 Legendary Soldier
				- melee weapon attack (1)
				- ally attack (1)
				- melee slow + 1/2 damage attack
			- "Skinny" Pete Yuuwbin / CR 3 Skirmisher
			- Jimmy "No-Bugs" Cammir / CR 3 Artillery
			- Penny "Big-Time" San-Tymiq / CR 3 Brute
			- Wanda "Gonna'Gettcha" Bund / CR 3 Soldier
			- Fern "Doesnt-want-a-nickname" Cinnamon / CR 4 Controller

It's likely that the party will attempt to continue their work for [[Alergra Barrowinch]], and travel to the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] & further to [[The Golden City]] to do so, if they are able to do so.

### Darnt Hillkeep

[[Baron Jammu]] is awaiting the arrival of the misfits, and will collect a day of rent from them if they stay the night in her territory.

### The Golden City

[[Doctor Gunagido]] is currently deep within the City, in a [[Golden Claws]]' laboratory. He has left his personal laboratory in statis-quo with his journeymen, telling them that he would only be able to return to them after his very important work had been completed, and that he does not know how long such a task will take, but to expect a communication from him before a week. They received a very generic letter from the High Ambassador [[Venclaw]] and have since ceased investigation.

### De-railed
We have encounters prepped, and tables & hexes for otherwise.
