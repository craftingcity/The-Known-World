It has been 12 sleeps since the party has seen the sun. The party plans to spend their current sleep in a public area of Ootool - the Large Purple Toadstool in the Servitor housing projects. Watches are to be shared by each member of party and one of their charges, a group they rescued from a monstrous spell-casting spider.

The Kalix Trogs, the Servitors, and the Ootool Hivemind live in tri-symboitic harmony here.
