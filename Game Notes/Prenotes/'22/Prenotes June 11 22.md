When last we left our heroes, they had begun their quest to retrieve packages for the Archmage Barrowinch from Yerba, Darnt Hillkeep, and The Golden City. They left the soft clutches of the city of Magius and walked along the road southeast. 

As the party passes by many acres of farmland, they begin to hear the natural shift-change of the dinural to the nocturnal. 

Do you travel through the night or make camp now?

### What does the World know?

The guards will begin to search for them, given the descriptions given from the Bartender of the Silver Unicorn and the five survivors of the parties "retaliation and defense of their members".

If the party travels through the night before making camp, along the road they would see a large lake to the south, dotted with many buildings, and far to their north, a large castle on a hill. Much of the surrounding area is barley fields. 

It will take the party four days to travel from [[Magius]] to [[Yerba]], which is the closest location, then four days to [[Darnt Hillkeep]], then closer to a week towards [[The Golden City]]. 

These calculations are for on foot, after a night of travel from Magius. Taking Horses for our party (that they could purchase for probably about 100sp per with some fine haggling) would double their speed, and make the theoretical two week deadline more reasonable.

In the hills far to the north of the [[Darnt Hillkeep]], by the road's bend, [[Barret Bodaim]] and his Bandits have made their home-camp. When Barret gets the report that there are some shmucks walking about with little-to-no protection and or high-value goods, he'll approve their shakedown, or further harassment if necessary.

A group of traveling hobgoblin merchants are moving between Yerba and Magius in the opposite direction of the party, though they would sell many delicacies of the Northeastern Territories.

> A beautifully rank melody wafts through you mind, swimming high and low, before calming to a deep hum. And staying there. And looming there. And waiting there.
	> for [[Breenabelle]]

> You awake in the middle of the night. Camp is calm, but undefended. Pip is agitated, as a deep hum begins to fill the air. Pip belches a white flame. It stares into your soul. You feel judged. You feel accepted, like a hug from a guardian. The hum does not cease. And then you wake up.
	> for [[Jarren]]

> An image of a goblin bleeding out and being picked to death by a vulture. A moment or so passes and the goblin slowly dies. Another moment. A low hum permeates the air, and the dead goblin opens its eyes.
	> for [[Nala]]

> You lay in a dark cold place. Some moments pass, before light pierces this darkness. A crack at first, and then with a loud bang and kick of dust, the light pours in. A deep hum wafts into your place of rest. Obscured by this blinding light behind them, a figure stands over you, says, "Let's have a chat, old friend", and grabs your head from your body by your eyes (like a bowling ball).
	> for [[Ulfgar]]

When the party awake the next day, they find a small glowing purple rabbit. She speaks as [[The Grand Archmage Alergra Barrowinch]] and chastises the party for their immediate lack of discretion. 

"Please, when a job is under the table like this, some things are infered. Is your reward not suitable for such a task? I am willing to rectify our contract if necessary, in both of our favors."

She also mentions that the Guards of Magius have mildly accurate descriptions and have put minor bounties (450sp) on all but [[Nala]] who has a much steeper bounty on her head (3000sp). To her all this means is that another dropoff point will need to be arranged.

### What happened this time?

I got the names for the people they need to get their packages from. [[Alisinder Rancarlo]] in [[Yerba]], [[Baron Jammu]] in the [[Darnt Hillkeep]], and [[Doctor Gunagido]] in [[The Golden City]].
