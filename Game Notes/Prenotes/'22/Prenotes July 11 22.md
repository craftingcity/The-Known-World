When last we left our heroes, they had begun their quest to retrieve packages for the Archmage Barrowinch from Yerba, Darnt Hillkeep, and The Golden City. They left the soft clutches of the city of Magius and walked along the road southeast. 

As the party passes by many acres of farmland, they begin to hear the natural shift-change of the dinural to the nocturnal. 

Do you travel through the night or make camp now?

The guards will begin to search for them, given the descriptions given from the Bartender of the Silver Unicorn and the five survivors of the parties "retaliation and defense of their members".

If the party travels through the night before making camp, along the road they would see a large lake to the south, dotted with many buildings, and far to their north, a large castle on a hill. Much of the surrounding area is barley fields.
