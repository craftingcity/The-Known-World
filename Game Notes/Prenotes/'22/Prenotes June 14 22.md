### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had returned safely to the surface, arriving in their home plane with their newest ally, [[Gudeliva]], and safely traveling to [[Kakurak]]'s lair. There, they were alone, until [[Kakurak]] soared into his sea-cave-lair, his trusty satyr servant [[Marcus]] riding meekly atop him.

"We have much to discuss..."

### What does the World Know?
[[Prenotes June 07 22]]

Very little changed last week, use the notes you already have to make a fun time. The "firey" area of [[The Holyl'nds]], west of [[Baskin]], is the minor lair of [[King Snure]].
