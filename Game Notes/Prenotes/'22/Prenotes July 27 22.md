### Intro
When we last left our heroes, after must shenanaganary, they had made their way into the town of Yerba. In its outskirts, Nala was disguised as a Red Dragonborn in an attempt to cover tracks before they are sought after and Jerren met with an old friend in Kirin of Kirin's Stables and procured a number of horses. Breenabelle led the party deeper into the city, to the [[Dragons Blood Inn]] to stay for the night. There the party met with the (orcish) patron of the establishment Nico Bennett, procured room and board for the night, and learned of a secret underground fighting collective that gathers in the basement of this very Inn.

### What does the World Know?
The in-game date is the 20th of Regrowth, 105AF; 20:30.

[[Alisinder Rancarlo]] is awaiting the arrival of "a band of unusual carriers" to pick up the Archmage's package, he will likely be easily convinced that these are the right couriers, because they are. 

Bets for fights are handled by Paul the Shady Elf, a now old spring elf. 

The matches on the main card tonight are:

Match | Fighter One | Fighter Two | Betting | Rolling
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Bungaloo Twins | Hillkeep's Finest | 1:2 | 12/20
2 | Kalipsum, Wildguardian Extrordinare | Dire Wolf | 4:1 | 2/20
3 | Frang, the Brusier | Cuzlywix Byuv | 3:2 | 5/20
4 | Albre Cain | Condor Falcon | 2:3 | 10/20
5 | Carrigen Mist | Grand Taku | 1:3 | 12/20
6+ | Fresh Meat | Champion of the Night | 10:1 | 1/20

Fighter | Class | Heritage
--- | --- | ---
Bungaloo Twins | Cleric & Rogue | Halfling
Hillkeep's Finest | Fighter & Fighter | Dwarven
Kalipsum | Ranger | Autumn-Elven
Frang | Fighter | Gnoll
Cuzly | Wizard | Mindflaer
Albre Cain | Barbarian | Human
Condor Falcon | Rogue | Kenku
Carrigen Mist | Warlock | Human
Grand Taku | Barbarian / Monk | Summer-Elven 

Yerba will know of the murder in the morning, and criers will shout it with the other news of the day. Guards will be on the lookout for these fugitives, and people who recognize them would report them.

Traveling from [[Yerba]] to the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] would take two days of travel by horseback. 

The party encounters a band of [[Barret Bodaim]]'s bandits their first night's rest.

The party encounters a merchant cart run by hobgoblin their second night's rest.

Arriving at the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] is an interesting process. When you make it to the hills, you're in the Hillkeep, but when you want to go see [[Baron Jammu]], you gotta go miles south to the "proper" [[Darnt Hillkeep]], a large human settlement that has integrated with the rest of the Hillkeep.

Traveling from the [[Darnt Hillkeep]] to one of the shore cities, likely [[Goldfield]], but possibly [[Aeberu]] or even [[Coalition City]] would take a day or less from Hillkeep proper.
