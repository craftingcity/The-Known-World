### Intro
Our story begins in a tavern, as all good stories do. We see a mass of people, and a one-eyed bartender deftly slinging drink and feed, but three figures in particular stand out to us in this moment. They are staring at a cork board on the wall, from which many parchments, ribbons, leathers, and other markings hang - the local Silver Unicorn's Message Board. Our camera cuts to a close hold on each of their faces. 

What does the camera see as we watch the figures each react to a job posting?

### What does the World Know?
Not a ton. We'll begin in [[Coalition City]], in a Silver Unicorn of the [[Iron Ward]].

We're beginning a new campaign. The party roster is here: [[Suk-uk, Seven, & Setella Roster]].
The following jobs are listed on the board;

In addition, each character knows two rumors; one is false, the other is true - dont tell them that though;
- Suk-uk (True); a Dragonborn by the name of [[Valerio Avishalom|Avishalom]] knows the champions of the Great Adventure Dragon [[Kakurak]]
- Suk-uk (False); 
- Seven (True); 
- Seven (False); the dwarves of [[Mountain Hall]] have a shoot-on-sight policy for outsiders - be wary traveling the [[Deakred Range]]
- Setella (True); the [[Actstow Hills]] holds a wealth of knowledge, history even from before the [[Great Fires]]
- Setella (False); the Library of [[The Golden City]] is grander than any you could imagine
