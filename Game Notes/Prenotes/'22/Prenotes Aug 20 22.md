### Intro
Our story begins in a tavern, as all good stories do. We see a mass of people, and a one-eyed bartender deftly slinging drink and feed, but three figures in particular stand out to us in this moment. They are staring at a cork board on the wall, from which many parchments, ribbons, leathers, and other markings hang - the Silver Unicorn's Message Board.
