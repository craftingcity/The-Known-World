### Intro
Our story begins in a tavern, as all good stories do. We see a mass of people, and a one-eyed bartender deftly slinging drink and feed, but three figures in particular stand out to us in this moment. They are staring at a cork board on the wall, from which many parchments, ribbons, leathers, and other markings hang - the local Silver Unicorn's Message Board. Our camera cuts to a close hold on each of their faces. 

What does the camera see as we watch the figures each react to a job posting?

### What does the World Know?
Not a ton. We'll begin in [[Coalition City]], in a Silver Unicorn of the [[Iron Ward]].

We're beginning a new campaign. The party roster is here: [[Suk-uk, Seven, & Setella Roster]].
The following jobs are listed on the board;
### What happened?

4 Wanted Posters
	- Villanela, elven woman, 9000sp, tax evasion
		- last seen fleeing home in [[Aeberu]]
	- Henry Ford, human man, 1000sp, arson
		- last seen at scene in [[Beacon]]
Smattering of "Odd Jobs"
	- Red Leather Strip; HELP WANTED: KAILKEEP

The party met Mary and Steve, a pair of Guardians of the Iron Ward; [[Mary Gullim]] is a fresh faced human fighter who instantly became infatuated with Setella, and [[Steve Wrainyr]] is a Too Cool ranger tactician who will back his girl no matter what, in that more experienced buddy-cop kinda way.
