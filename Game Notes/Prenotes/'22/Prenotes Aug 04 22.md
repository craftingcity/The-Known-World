### Intro
When we last left our heroes, they had completed their meeting with their Draconic Patron, [[Kakurak]], and had elected to assault the forward operating base of their arch-enemies; [[Giant's Toe]]. We rejoin them after days of Grouling travel through the sweltering heat of the new domain of your Fire Giant opposition. The red-hot Holyl'nd stuck melted to your boots, all remnants of flora or fauna boiled or burned. Here they stand before a large keep of stone and brass, marked by a large flaming fist grasping a crown.


### What does the World Know?
[[Giant's Toe]].

### What happened?
The party entered [[Giant's Toe]] from the large entrance at the south of the keep. From here, they traveled north-east, slaughtering all opposition in their way. They saved five civilians, and one who decided to join them fell upon third contact with the Whitimore Matron, whom they too slaughtered.
