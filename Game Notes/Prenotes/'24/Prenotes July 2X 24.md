### Intro
When last we left our hero, they and their party had made their way into the Mall of the City, where they infiltrated and assaulted Nail's Gang. The Squad made contact with members of Nails Gang on the first and second floors, and handily defeated them.

Nail made empty threats against you over the radio after you had defeated the majority of his gang, and invited you to meet him on the third floor, assumedly with combat in mind. You have hidden the corpses and gear of those you have killed here, securing your bag for later collection - for now, you have a gangster to kill.

#### Mall Stores Loot
The Mall has ~150/~125 stores. Given that Nail and others have already looted most of it, the loot should be minimal from the stores.

7 stores can be looted for 20x ac, but you kinda gotta search all the stores to get all 20 - otherwise there's a decent chunk of scrap and material

#### Around the Mall...
