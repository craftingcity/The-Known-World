### Intro
When last we left our hero, they and their party had made their way into the Mall of the City, where they infiltrated and assaulted Nail's Gang. The Squad made contact with members of Nails Gang on the first and second floors, and handily defeated them.

Nail made empty threats against you over the radio after you had defeated the majority of his gang, and invited you to meet him on the third floor, assumedly with combat in mind. You have hidden the corpses and gear of those you have killed here, securing your bag for later collection - for now, you have a gangster to kill.

#### Mall Stores Loot
The Mall has ~150/~125 stores. Given that Nail and others have already looted most of it, the loot should be minimal from the stores.

7 stores can be looted for 20x ac, but you kinda gotta search all the stores to get all 20 - otherwise there's a decent chunk of scrap and material

#### Around the Mall...
###### Hospital
The Hospital is home to a nest of Demons on it's first and basement floors, and a host of Fallen maintain an outpost upon the floors above the nest - a supply center of Artlocked Caches (of which some are open).

The first floor consists of a reception, a pair of examination rooms, and an office. Stairs and Elevators lead to the basement, and the second floor. 

	The reception is bloody, and significantly damaged since its construction - given the fresh boot-prints in the blood, and the debris cleared into paths, this place is occupied. The examination rooms mirror the reception and the office, and both have been roughly handled and left to time. The office has been retrofit into a mildly defensible camp, but this room too is bloodied and boot-printed. Scratches on the wall suggest a large beast was the culprit.

hospital safe (33ac + receipts)

The second floor consists of more than a dozen examination rooms, and a surgery wing of 4 clean-chambers and a large supply room.

	The walls between the examination rooms have been torn through as to connect them all into a series of interconnected chambers. These rooms have been refit as to be an efficient barracks. The surgery wing has been largely gutted, where the clean-rooms have been transformed into prayer chambers, filled with candles, written scripts, and scrawled with adages of the Obelisk. The supply room is the most well maintained space in a civilized sense, as the shelves and cold storages are stable and maintained. The center of the chamber is filled with Darksteel Artilocked Caches, including the following items;
		- 1x Arms
