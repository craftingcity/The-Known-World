### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had successfully assaulted the Black Swan's warehouse hideout, killing a number of the Black Swans themselves, but sparing their Alchemists for the moment as you turned to loot the place. The drugs here amount to a small fortune, but the party lacks access to the necessary infrastructure to transport and distribute the amount of illicit goods present here.

While these drugs could be an issue all their own, if you care to interact with them further, you also have requests from the Duche of [[Bandeer]] to eliminate certain members of the Black Swans and assign blame to the question of who burnt down the Hardwick farm.

With a pair of bald masked humans comfortably restrained, and the bodies of those you slew before you, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

Push a scene with the Kid (Jonas) and the Troopers (Sgt. Borhan) if they do anything but go see Jonas or interact with the Troopers. Killing Black Swans is fine, but they're really local - the party can go squash the last few guys if they really want to, it'll just kill time and scratch them off the list. 

Other plots include...
	- What does Duche Hedwig want next for us?
	- How do we deal with the drugs?
	- What is Web Spun Solutions doing? Is [[Mountain Hall]] okay?
	- (Does SeaSec care about the party?)

Hedwig also promised to equip and inform the party - if Eve doesn't suggest stopping in [[Cenva Minyo]], Hedwig will.


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
