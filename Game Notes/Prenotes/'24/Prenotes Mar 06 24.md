### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had escaped from the ruins of [[Tilemundon's White Tower]] in [[Kamarios]] and reported back to the disappointed [[Agrandica]] before being attack by an unidentified group of well-equipped assailants. 

While you are without your Paladin, you were able to handle the opposition, and we return to the party now as they have finalized their rest. It is the morning of the 18th, and the day is yours; what will you do with it?

### What does the World Know?

See [[Prenotes Feb 28 24]]

### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the morning of the 19th of Weeding, 105 AF, as they are deciding what to do, where they are returning to Golden City to find more information on [[Qiell Tilemundon]] and his associates in the powers of the Desert.
