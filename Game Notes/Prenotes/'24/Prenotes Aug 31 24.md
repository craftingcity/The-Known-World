### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had travelled for a few days towards the city of Mossburg - but along the way, they were assaulted by a trio of bandits! Through combat, the party eliminated the threat, and spent the night recovering.

We return to the party now as they gather their camp and prepare for their final day of travel - thoughts of the Mossburg Great Vault, and your auditing assignment.

### What does the World Know?
Mossburg is a beautiful city, it's walls and streets are well-kept. The people here mostly keep to themselves, and there is almost always a set of Enforcers visible on any street corner.

```
The Mossburg Great Vault is a public bank operated by Calvin Ameex under the approval of the [[Baron Vannis]].

Two stories and a basement - an office, public floor, and the vault - leave little to be desired by its 2,400 patrons. There are 12 employees at the bank, and the son of the manager - Binx Ameex. There are 4 stationed Enforcers, two on the first floor, two at the vault.

The vault is locked to a bio-chanted key and a 6" lead lining around a 1' mild-steel casing.

There are over 300 registered and filled personal lockboxes at MGV, of which ~3 are of the recently deceased;

JAMES, Frank - 6+ years of registry, "Business Profits"
	- 7442sp
	- a carved ivory knight with the phrase 'Fight for Honor, Ride the Road' inscribed on the base.
	- identification documents for a "Alab Hanz" of the Church of the White Flame
KILLFISH, The - 1+ years of registry, "Storage"
	- 1138sp
	- 6 bars of Mythril
	- 18 bars of Dark Steel
	- 1 Bar of Chaos Gold
	- 24 Purple Chitin
SALEEN, Alex - 8+ years of registry, "My Bag"
	- a large pouch inlaied with fine embroidery

Alex Saleen's 'Large Pouch' is a Immutable Bag of Holding, inside of which there is 6 pp, a silver shifting cube, and a list of cities in which Alex has other equipment.
```

While the possibility of the party entering, acquiring, and exiting, without conflict exists, if things go wrong, Binx will sound the alarm and close down the bank, locking everyone inside until an Enforcer response.

In the future, the Guilds would expunge employment from Carmen and Oliver, and potentially send a group after them (especially if they get after Alex Saleen's Bag) if they are alerted to the events.
