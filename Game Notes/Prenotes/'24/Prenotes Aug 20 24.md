## Party of Interest: [[NewSarahouse Game]]
- [ ] DM Screen
- [ ] Notepaper
- [ ] Prep
	- [ ] maps?
	- [ ] encounters / monsters?
	- [ ] intro / recap?

## Pregame Vibe Check
- Character Goals & Meat; do you each feel comfortable in your character, and do they have a motivation or goal that is pushing them?
- Round Table; 'Air your Concerns'
- Questions regarding content? Ask Away.

Sarah - Genasi is not a lore I have, so I don't feel good characterizing.
Rhea - Hey that was a personal conflict regarding my participation.
Brock - I feel like I'm getting there, but I don't know what the goals are.
Tyke - Kinda, but I don't know my motivation. I changed my character while playing because it's still developing for me, a goal would give me an easier time finding myself in the group
Hannah - My character is who she is, and I feel like I'm being left out. I have a short term goal, and maybe a longer term goal but our ingame relationships are weird.

Metagame recaps, or incharacter recaps
