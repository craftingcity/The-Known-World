### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had gathered themselves upon an outcrop in the miles long drill-tunnel in the 35th plot of the 15th [[Mountain Hall]] Mining Colony. Without major magical means, you must ascend towards the surface, or you will meet your fate in the dark hell under the earth.

You are uncertain of the conditions you would ascend towards; Who snapped your cords? Does anyone know you're missing? What the fuck is "Web Spun Solutions"?

These questions and more wrack the minds of our heroes as we return to them upon the ledge.

### What does the World Know?
The party has interacted with the following Web Spun Employees;
	- Hobart Youngkeeper, Warehouse Manager (OMG I missed you guys what happened?)
	- Val Dalm, Plot Foreman (fuck me we got canned. and really it's your fault asshole.)
	- Edgars Banchi, Carriage Driver (OMG thank fuck, I missed you and these new guys are asses)

WSS has canned the party, and the 35th Plot has been requisitioned by the DWD, and the Mountain Trooper Corps have begun to cordon and investigate.

Trooper Borehan is present and knowledgeable about the Underdark breaches within Mountainhall, and the possibility of connections towards [[The Old|Minyostalma]], and maybe [[Limbo]].

Eve's mother, Kaymin "Kay" Laush, has received and replied to Eve's letter;
	"Eve,
	I'm glad to hear from you. Your siblings are well, as is your Father.
	Regarding the Duche, I trust him as far as I can throw him. He is an a'Alden - he is minor, but a noble nonetheless. If he does not get what he wants from you, I am sure that he would make attempts to take it. His attempt to leverage our connection into using you leaves me disgusted. 
	I worked under him while I was still a CPK in [[Bandeer]]. He had goals of becoming more than a pencil-pusher, and now he is. I could not imagine that you would complete his requests and he would grant you the full honor of your actions. He will not leave this be - you must respond to some degree. In any case: be cautious, and be smart. I know you will do good.
	With love,
	Mama Kay"

### What happened?
