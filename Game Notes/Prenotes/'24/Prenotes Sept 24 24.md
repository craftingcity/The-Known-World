### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had arrived in the small city of [[Bandeer]], an unwalled and welcoming farming town nearby to both the beginnings of the Holyl'nds and Coalition City. Upon their arrival, they began to inform themselves on the politics of Bandeer, with a particular interest in the Hardwick family's farmstead. 

Having spoken with Britannya Hardwick, the party investigated the farm itself and identified with full certainty that the alchemical accelerant Huumpo was used to burn the Hardwick's fields. Suspecting members of the Farmsteading Union, the party travelled next-door, to the Blackacid Estates.

Whyre Blackacid made entering the estates difficult, and attempted to wholly bar your entry, to no avail - Eve simply forced her entry, and Thomas quickly moved to support her.

We return to the party as Rowan, Bhodie, and Marilynn watch Whyre stomp his way into town, leaving you all to act as you wish upon the estate.
