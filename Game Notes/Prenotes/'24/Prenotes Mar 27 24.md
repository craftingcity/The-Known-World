### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had been rocked by the loss of their party Paladin, Shu Ameda. Fueled by their grief, they sought revenge in [[The Golden City]] to little effect. Frustrated, the party acknowledged their desires on the World Stage required opportunity they lacked, and returned to their personal pursuits.

Conferring with your connections in [[Yahlin]], you gathered information on both your personal and world-stage desires - but before you could form a plan to act on this new information, Cucu was made aware that her dear cousin Romeo had disappeared - and had not been seen in the weeks after which he said he would be back.

The party agreed to help Cucu find her cousin, and now look toward the mysterious dangers of Minyostalma - the old Elven empire that never was. 

### What does the World Know?

Romeo has had time to get to [[The Old|Minyostalma]], a quick jaunt across the border from [[Yahlin]]. He was recruited by a group of wannabe Scavs who had little experience and poor equipment, but after his first days in the Old, he began to survive and even progress toward the Temple; see [[Romeo's Journal]].


### What happened?

Yahlin's [[Tori Lane]] have been tasked with identifying Cucu's Gold & Silver liquid, the black ooze experiments, and they sold a lot of shit to her.

Balthazar heard about their trip to Minyostalma and gives them the following;
- Heamox Balm (x5) (+2d6hp  / round for 8 rounds & 1 Hit Die)
- Isiopara (x20 / 5 lb) (+3d4 + 10hp / round for 3 rounds)
- Secreclude Propaterol (x10) (+20hp / round for 3 rounds)
- Hazardous Environment Facial Protector Mark 2 (x5) (+15 RadRes)
- Ambebamol (x35) (+6 RadRed / 25 rounds)
- Pro-Finder Mark 1 (x1) (45ft radius)
- EWD Handheld (x3) (20ft radius)

We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
