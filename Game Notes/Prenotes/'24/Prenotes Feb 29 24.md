### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had arrived safely in "Mercy", a neutral settlement on the second layer of [[Kailkeep]]. With the desire to escape this sidequest gone wrong, you offered a small number of your magical items to Barkeep in exchange for as many gold-ruby "Pick-up Sticks Tokens" as he could find. 

With the knowledge that you may never step foot into "Mercy" again, you gave your goodbyes to Benjamin, Yissa, and Aramond, collected your equipment, and headed to the gates of the settlement. 

The gate-guard begins to make preparations and an alarm begins to blare - "Roamers are exiting Mercy. Please become defensible." After a minute, the gate creaks open again - just enough for you to leave by single file. There is a series of hide sacks behind the left bunker as you exit, seemingly bursting with gore and gear. 

With five paths before you, I must ask - what do you do?
