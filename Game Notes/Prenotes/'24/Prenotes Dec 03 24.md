### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had returned to the [[Deakred Range]] to investigate the company that had hired them, [[Web Spun Solutions]], and the effects of the quarantine declared in the surrounding Mining Colonies - which has seemingly spread since your last visit.

Upon their investigation of the 4th Mining Colony, they found a trio of stationed guards wielding Durandurm Carbine Blasters who were wholly unprepared to communicate with or assist you. They quickly retreated to the top of the supply center as they fired upon you, screaming into their Sending Stones that they need backup, that they've encountered an unknown threat; you.

We return to the party as they push forward, deeper into Colony 4, sprinting away into the 14th Plot to pursue further investigation. With the echoes of your footsteps behind you, you run through the tunnel and into the main cavern of Plot 14, finding a sight very familiar - much of this space is filled with boxes and carts filled with rocks and gravel. You see the bore-pit, the drill, and the descent cabling all together some 50' in front of you, and a small barracks and tool shed are tucked off to your right, 15' off.

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

See [[Prenotes Aug 13 24#What does the World Know?]]. 

The Troopers really don't want to chase down the party without backup, even though they probably could win the fight, so they're going to let them run off "back where they came from".

The more genuine threats will come from disturbing the interior of the bore-pit, where a pseudo-brain rests and grows. The Barracks is occupied by too many dwarves, all bloodied and static. Their perception is disabled to preserve power for the growth of the pseudo-brain, excepting one; Ayoyt Gruikaine, a transport merc working with [[Web Spun Solutions]], delivering Metallics to the Plots of the Mining Colonies. They come from a place called [[Forgehome]], and they have since come to this plot after the destruction of their caravan in Plot 21 by another of the mercs, who was acting *super* weird.

### What happened?

At the plot, they sprung the pseudo-brain's trap! By interacting with Ayoyt, they've captured the psywaves of the local fauna;
20 - PSEUDO-BRAIN
10 - Psy Pawns
8 - Spaceteam
1 - The Innocent

We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
