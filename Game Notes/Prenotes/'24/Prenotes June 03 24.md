### Intro

Hey gamers, lets see what we're working with.

### What does the World Know?
##### Notable Factions in Starting Area
- [[Mossburg Enforcers]] are the governmental body of Mossburg and the surrounding areas.
- [[Riphounds]] and [[Slimknives]] are allied together, and are set to exploit all opponent weaknesses.
- [[Grovetenders]] and [[Dampguard]] are fair game for Enforcers too, but they present less of an immediate threat.
- A majority of the [[Druids of Aquan]] are present throughout the southeast.

##### Some Things that could have happened
- Someone's important person has been yoinked by the [[Mossburg Enforcers]]
- [[Riphounds]], [[Slimknives]], and [[Dampguard]] all have their reason, but they hurt someone close.
- You know or work with someone in the above factions.

- ... you're my friend! How long have we known each other, and how do we feel about the way we act now?
- ... I am bound to you! Why do I serve you? What am I to you? How do we feel about our relationship?
- ... we survived together! What did we escape or survive, and how did we get out? How has our relationship changed since? Do I owe you?
- ... we're on the run together! What did we do, how did we escape, and what's the plan now?
