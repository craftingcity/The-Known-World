### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had escaped the bowels of [[Kailkeep]] and were teleported to the frontlines of the war against Celaena. Accompanied by the Red Mage, [[Alergra Barrowinch]], the Hatdroppers stealthily made their way into [[Boneborn]] and made visual contact with the Bloody Red Portal there.

We return to the party as they convene in the spa of their Bag of Rooms, as Jerran relays his knowledge of the surrounding area.

### What does the World Know?

#### GOOBA STATS
Celaena wants to protect her portal but isnt worried about it "going down" now that she has forces here.

Celaena is a demonic princess of incredible capability. She has three Legendary Resistances per long rest that she may spend to succeed on a Saving Throw she would fail. In addition, she has three Legendary Actions per round that she may spend at the end of a player's turn.

As a one-point legendary action, cast a spell or make two melee attacks.

As a one-point legendary action, make a mental or verbal command and, select up to five allied fiends (all ur guys) you can see. You grant the chosen fiends a standard action in their attempts to obey you.

As a two-point legendary action, summon forth a number of demons from the active bloodportal (pick one, roll);
- 1d3 Apebeast
- 1d3 Spinebeast
- 2d4 Hellhound
- 1d3 Black Ooze
- 1d3 Cousin in Arms
