### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had breached the interior of the horrible White Tower in the small town of [[Kamarios]] in an attempt to make meeting with the Black Mage, [[Qiell Tilemundon]]. You did so, with major losses. Your honorable goons have been turned to ash on the walls, and in return, you procedurally executed Qiell. As he fell to the floor, he extended a wry smile, and suddenly the machines in the chamber activated.

With Qiell's corpse on the floor, green steam bubbles and rises from the tanks surrounding Kalariel. A hiss rings out against the silence, as the chamber opens, and a rotten man steps forth... He raises his arms, and the room is filled with a dank yellow brown gas.

###### AFTER COMBAT
I'm unsure of where they're planning to escape to, but we know that the two members of [[Agrandica's Thieves]] should report back with as much loot as they can carry. Given the lives lost, this mission can only be considered a failure in her eyes - a debt is owed. How they wish to pay this debt is mostly up to them, she requires resources of all variety, manpower inclusive - (but I have no prediction of how they would expand recruitment) - a shipment of Durandurm would be most desirable.

Moses has been schmoovin in [[Wychway]] with [[Jorrin Bearscarred]], and has managed to set an introduction for the two, less than formally of course, but he is hopeful for the future.
	- Relevant to this group, this moves Arthur much closer towards honoring his deal with the Bulls regarding a genuine assault on [[The Church of the White Flame]].

The Demons have taken Beacon, and hold the South Road in [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]]. [[Baron Xuiop]] is dead, and [[Baron Avory]] has retreated to [[Barkryn]]. The Coalition have since called for an [[Emergency Communicae c. 105AF]] on the 20th in attempts to unite an effort against the demonic invaders, much as they did the Giants two years before.
