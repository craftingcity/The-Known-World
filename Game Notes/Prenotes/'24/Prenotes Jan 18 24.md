### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had trespassed into the hell of Kailkeep, ascended beyond the False Allure of the lower levels and had arrived at a game of Red Rover, wherein they fought to the death a group of bloodied guards wearing the armor of the [[Golden Claws]]. 

They lay now gory at your feet, and you stand in a massive stone chamber with ruins and rubble creating a dynamic battlefield. You can still hear the cheers of the Kobolds you can see in the stands behind the screens filtering out as the show has ended. As the cheering gets quieter, the sound of grinding stone grows louder, and the walls of this massive chamber reveal a number of ways to egress this room.

What do you do?
