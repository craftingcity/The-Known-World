### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they cast their legacy onto the face of the world. On their way west, towards where they last saw the dragon they had accidentally released, the party stopped into [[Zalfari]], the capital city of the [[Grovetenders]] territories. There, they were graced with the last personal meeting [[Baron Cassindil]] would ever make. The Baron attempted, poorly, to answer the questions posed to him by his employee, who decided that the punishment for the Baron's unsatisfying responses would be death. 

The delivery was swift. The Baron now lies dead on the floor of their office, beaten and burned beyond recognition, and the people guarding them are now chunks of flesh dripping from the walls of the illustrious meeting room. An unexpected betrayal.

The building is burning. You have moments to flee, and you take them. You continue west through the city for some time, distancing yourself from the scene. 

It is the evening of the 26th day of Harvest, in the 106th year. Here, in the city of [[Zalfari]], you are wanted, but you know you have time before you would be found, let alone held responsible. You collect yourselves on a cobbled road, surrounded by buildings of brick and timber. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

See [[Prenotes Sep 13 25]].

#### Visiting SEASEC
##### Mossburg
- We're in a full on war at this point. Defense (Enforcers, Loyalists, Knights) vs Offence (SEASEC, Militia of Scum, RDFP / Harvard, Avalon)
##### Amourain / Slimknives (or Beacon)
##### Goldfield / Dampguard 
##### Barkryn / Riphounds (or Beacon)
##### What do We do about the Grovetenders?
- Well, we're going to end up fighting the Sunnites for it. We shouldn't do that right now, we need to take and restabilize Mossburg first, but the Dampguard is right there, so we can mess with them some. Harvard might present an issue if he somehow allies with them, but that seems unlikely.
#### Tailing Tymirek
##### To Kailkeep
##### To Tetrimoc
#### Heading into The Jungle
##### Why do we need to go there?
- From the SEASEC perspective, you guys might just be going around fucking up anyone unaligned with 
##### What's happening when we get there?
