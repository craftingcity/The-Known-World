### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had travelled from the Old Empire of Minyostalma back into [[Coalition City]], reaching for their first steps towards their well deserved revenge. As preparation, you gathered power in magical scrolls and a Guilded bank account before you continued towards the last known location of Doctor [[Otto Malkovich]], where you will attempt to make contact with him and resolve lingering questions about the death of Nikolai's birth-parents.

With yourselves and your equipment gathered, in the dimming light of the evening sun, the Doctor's condo awaits...

### What does the World Know?

##### Dr. Otto M's House
A two-story stone brick house in the Stone Ward of [[Coalition City]], the Doctor's Condo holds three rooms on each floor. The house is designed to promote the Doctor's (and by extension his assistant's) workflow.

###### Kitchen
> *Off the left of the Lounge, and below the Apprentice's Quarters, a Kitchen lies dormant. Clean and proper, everything is resting its place - the room smells of citrus. In the center of the room, a large black brick oven with an attached grey panel of dials and gauges takes up the majority of the space. Along the countertop at the edges of the walls, an array of jars and bags hold spices and dried food - though it is all stored far from the black marble surface on the opposed side of the counter. The shelves below the counter hold jarred goods and cast-iron cookware - some hundreds of silver worth of ingredients and utensils.*

- Alchemical Hotplate & Cooking Tools
	- Upon the counter, a black sheet of obsidian or some other glossy black stone acts as a precise heating element. The action is controlled by simple cantrip.
- Food & Spice Storage
	- Below the counters, over 300sp worth of cast-iron and wooden cookware and foodstuff is stored away, untouched for weeks now.
- Baking Oven
	- A large box of racks uses the same system as the hotplate to provide a larger general heating element. The oven has been deeply cleaned.

###### Library Lounge
> *The grand entrance of this modest home leads directly into the Lounge, where a pair of wall-wrapping bookshelves stocked with journals, histories, and theories. Accompanying the shelves, a set of lounge loveseats surround a pale wooden table. On the right wall, by the door to the Workroom, a pale wooden writing desk sits, unorganized, as if mid-thought. On the left wall, a door leads into the Kitchen. Looking back, between the shelves, the central door leads into the Master's Quarters.*

- Wrapping Bookshelves
	- The collection of books here mostly regard the history of magical theory and technological progress, but there are a significant number of journals and grimoires from now deceased wizards (including copies of [[The Axioms, Theories, and Philosophies of Mages of the First Century]], [[Guraxlog's Grimoire]], [[Barrowinch's University Collection]], and [[Waywalket's Workbook]].
- Ostentatious Loveseats
	- A pile of papers litters the table by the loveseats, alongside a pencil and a book titled 'The Exploration of Physical Spirit'. The papers are arcane notes and diagrams drawn or written in pencil, by one Anita Rewch. Progress is being made in a sort of detection spell for the intensity of a person's Faith.
- Pale Wood Desk
	- There are dozens of papers and books strewn about on the desk. The first drawer of the desk is locked, but it contains a series of official notices from the [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]]'s **Ideology Correction Corps** that span over the course of 6 months. They first begin regarding Dr Malkovich's reassignment into the field of experimental genetics, then his ignorance of this request, a demand for reported progress, and finally, a warning demand that Otto will return to [[Kohnstamm]] immediately, or be forcibly relocated.
	- The other drawers hold stationary and relevant supplies that would be valued in total at over 100sp.

###### Workroom Lab
> *Off the right of the Lounge, and below the Wash & Source Room, the Workroom-Lab is a pristine, clean, alchemist's dream. The room is split into four quarters by purpose. The first, the close corner on the right is stuffed full of metal shelves centering around a thick black door. To the left, a system of tubes, burners, and bottles form some kind of alchemical liquid production. Opposing the Liquids Production, a simple wooden door lies locked. In the far right and final corner, another alchemical rube-goldberg machine of funnels and grinders seem to be processing a solid into a powder. Between the Casting Closet and Powder Production, a spiral staircase in the wall leads up into the Wash & Source Room.*

- Liquids Production
	- The second corner of the room hosts a set of cabinets that forms a workspace on which a complex series of tubes and containers slowly continues dripping away. Currently, two small flames are boiling a pair of brightly colored liquids that work their way through the system, concluding in tiny, infrequent drops of *Red Water*. The bottle being filled currently holds 3oz of *Red Water*, of a possible 8oz it could hold. 
- Powder Assembly
	- The third corner of the room hosts a set of cabinets that forms a workspace on which a number of tools used to abrade solids into powders, such as centrifuges and mortar-pestles. This area is thoroughly clean.
- Casting Closet
	- The first corner of the room holds many metal shelves and a darksteel 'Casting Closet', a heat-treatment chamber used to cast liquids or solids into a particular shape. The Casting Closet is currently disabled, having recently finished its production cycle in the creation of a half-dozen *Heatcores*.
- Overly Organized Closet
	- The fourth and final corner of the room hosts a simple-looking wooden door. When opened, the door acts as a Type-2 Gate into a Consistent Extraplanar Instance (CEI). This CEI is a large closet, where hundreds of alchemical samples and supplies are organized, stored, and labeled.
	- The potential total value of the contents of the CEI amounts to over 100,000sp, though the transportation of the total contents would present difficulties.

###### Apprentice's Quarters
> *Above the Kitchen, accessible by a set of small stone stairs, is the Apprentice's Quarters - Anita Rewch currently occupies this room and this role, though she hasn't seen Master Otto in about a month, since his business in the Holyl'nds. These quarters are small, and spartan; there is room for one here, and one alone. A pale wood chest pushes up to foot of the beige bed, and opposing it, leaning against the other wall - only 3' away - a modest pale wood dresser is topped in the only personality the room has, a set of six brightly colored knitted character dolls. The third wall in this room is a massive bookshelf. It is clean, but obviously underused.*

- Anita's Chest
	- A small wooden chest holds the personal items Anita has stored away, including a pair of old diaries describing her personal and professional life, two sets of comfortable lounge clothing, and a mid-sized knit plushie of a goat. The Chest cannot be opened at the same time as the Dresser.
- Anita's Bed
	- A single bed is perfectly made, where the sheets and blankets are tightly tucked against the mattress.
- Anita's Dresser & Dolls
	- The shoulder-high dresser holds four identical white-linen coats for use during labs, a set of heartier working clothes, and a collection of simple underwear. Additionally, stored in the boots of her work-outfit, Anita keeps a small jar of cannabis and a ceramic pipe for her personal use.
	- On the top of the dresser, the following set of six knitted character plushies are carefully positioned such that none would fall;
		- A white rabbit-like creature with a black head and ears. It is wearing a black collar with pink spots.
		- A chubby yellow dog with a cute smile. It is wearing a brown 
- Anita's Bookshelf

###### Master Bedroom
> *The central room of the house, securely invisible to the outside, is the Master Bedroom - the domain of Otto Malkovich, while he was a free man. In the center of the room, away from the walls, a large comfortable bed is flanked by a series of glass cases and a large wardrobe. Pushed against the far wall is a very large table adorned in ornate cloth, candles, and inscription.*

###### Wash & Source Room
> *Above the Workroom, a simple space holds a ceramic chair full of water, a set of sponges and soaps on the edge of a large basin, and an encased water production system.*
