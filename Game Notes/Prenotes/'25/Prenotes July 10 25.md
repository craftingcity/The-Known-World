### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had breached the first containing wall surrounding the [[Kohnstamm]] city-area, killing a patrolling squad along the way, and now preparing for their treck forward towards the city itself. Your investigations of [[Otto Malkovich]] have led you to believe he is working somewhere in the city on an "experimental genetics" project, under forceful authority of the Ideology Correction Corps, and your recent encounter with the standing guards reinforce your understanding that this is a city at war - prepared against invasions, even such as the one you are attempting to facilitate. With that understanding in mind, I will ask, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?
They're coming in from the South, likely the best way to directly access [[Kohnstamm]] itself. They don't necessarily have to move through the smaller towns, so long as they say they're sticking to the wilds they'll be alright, but the second wall around [[Kohnstamm]] proper presents a hard obstacle they'll have to traverse.

#### Force
This is the classic - we get to run through a lot of combat, but it might be a slog. We can minimize this by trading these combats for immediate progress and reward, and allowing these Heroes their unusual, war-breaking feats. Obviously not all the army can come fight, or would know to - logistics and communication win battles, and our Heroes are their own logistics engines, so they do just get to keep moving around, making opposing communication less useful, this looks like some kind of 'alert level' like thing, maybe I put a die down to make it look like a real mechanic while I pump the number of combatants or their stats or something.
#### Coercion
We force someone into doing what we want, like bringing us all into the city under a cart or something. This might just work out, based on the devices they are utilizing and their execution and such, but it would at least get them to the gates of [[Kohnstamm]] itself, and then turn to Force.
#### Deception
We somehow lie or sneak our way in. This would be the most difficult option, in my opinion, but I won't throw a fit if they work it out - their Orc is technically a Patron, and would be under the typical legal protections, and otherwise they are all legal, but without paperwork. Slipping through and around will be the best way this works out, having a direct confrontation where they have to provide some kind of documentation would be potentially disastrous - they have no official reason to be travelling to and from the city during wartime, which likely qualifies as 'failure of responsibility to the state', a grievous crime.

#### The Experimental Genetics Facility
##### Reception
The ground floor of the EGF is a genuine hospital, receiving and treating patients for minor injuries or diseases.

##### Offices and Research
The second floor of the EGF is composed of offices and small clean rooms used for 'dry experiments' regarding the genetics research being done here.

##### Barracks
The third floor of the EGF is a series of cul-de-sac style living quarters, including built-in kitchen and laundry facilities, and secure armories. 

##### Experiments
The fourth floor of the EGF is composed of four large configurable 'experimentation chambers' where live subjects are forced to complete a series of tests or activities.

##### Containment
The fifth floor of the EGF is a secure holding facility for the living beings used as subjects in these experiments.

##### Basement
The basement floor of the EGF is a large butcher/kitchen operation that takes the corpses of the subjects here and turns them into food for the surviving subjects.
