### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had returned to [[Coalition City]] on the hunt for [[Otto Malkovich]], a researcher and alchemist working under the White Church's Ideology Correction Corps. Searching the doctor's condo, you gathered a horde of wealth and a companion in [[Anita Rewch]], and though you failed to locate the Doctor himself, you did recover a series of documents indicating the topic of his research was "experimental genetics" and that suggest he has "returned to [[Kohnstamm]]" or face the threats made by the ICC.

With Anita and her dolls safely amongst you, you lit the condo on fire and fled into the Wheel Ward's Silver Unicorn, where we return to see the party gathering themselves around a table of food and drink they have ordered, deciding what exactly they'll be doing next.
