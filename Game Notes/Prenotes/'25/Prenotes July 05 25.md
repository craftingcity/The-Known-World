### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had returned to [[Coalition City]] on the hunt for [[Otto Malkovich]], a researcher and alchemist working under the White Church's Ideology Correction Corps. Searching the doctor's condo, you gathered a horde of wealth and a companion in [[Anita Rewch]], and though you failed to locate the Doctor himself, you did recover a series of documents indicating that his topic of his research was reassigned to "experimental genetics", and that he has been forcibly "returned to [[Kohnstamm]]" under the order of the Ideology Correction Corps.

With Anita and her plushies safely amongst you, you lit the condo on fire and fled into the Wheel Ward's Silver Unicorn, where we return to see the party gathering themselves around a table of food and drink they have ordered, deciding what exactly they'll be doing next.

### What does the World Know?
##### Otto Malkovich
Otto has been relocated to [[Kohnstamm]]'s Experimental Genetics Facility, a well guarded prison where researchers perform live experiments on people for the benefit of the Church's military prowess.

From one of the many Desks of Personal Management of the ICC, [[Colin Talaveem]] was the Desk that reassigned Dr. Malkovich from his, Victor's, and Anna's life-extension and -transference project (designated as a general 'Explorative Study') to the more pressing wartime efforts at the EGF.

[[Kohnstamm]] has seen some damage in the face of the [[Northern Conflicts, c.105af]], but maintain their strict guard around the city to the best of their ability, being an incredibly important strategic resource to the Church.

Reaching the city itself will be a challenge, entering it likely more so, and entering the EGF would be relatively impossible at the moment.
##### The Northern Conflicts
The [[Northern Conflicts, c.105af]] have coalesced around [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln|Kanielkiln]], but significant change has come to the southern regions of [[The Holyl'nds]].

Roan has an assignment to disrupt or disturb Prosperian forces at the western flank of the Conflict. By causing Prosper to focus on their efforts in the West, they would fail to support their allies in the South attempting to take the city of [[Mossburg]].

##### The NotADeer
The Arbiter known as Notadeer comes to Otto, gaining contract to free him and keep his research, in exchange for his soul, and eventually his physical form - but this can act as a 'deus ex machina' in his moment of need.

#### Travelling
From [[Coalition City]], your two choices are to travel North first, or to travel West first.
