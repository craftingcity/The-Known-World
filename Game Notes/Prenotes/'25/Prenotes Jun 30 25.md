### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had shaken the city of [[Mossburg]] to it's core. Under the direction of a series of letters, you four came together for a job that resulted in a massive explosion at the Mossburg Garrison in the Central District, crippling the Enforcer's control of the city. After celebrating a job well done, you all returned to the Araborum for a good nights rest. In the morning, you gather together at the bar to find a series of packages awaiting you. 

With the day before you, and opportunities presenting themselves to you, I must ask; what do you want to do?

### What does the World Know?
#### The Garrison's Destruction
The Enforcers of Mossburg have been crippled. The time comes to apply the final blows.
	+ Factions arise within Mossburg as local influences
		- Enforcers (in the Central District)
		- Ring District's Free People (on the Western half of the Ring District)
		- Avalon Shepards (on the Eastern Half of the Ring District)
		- Militia of Scum (at and around the Scum & Villainy of the northern Ring District) 
	+ Outside factions move assets into Mossburg
		- The [[Hillkeep Loyalists]] and the [[Knights in Red]] move forces into the city at the request of [[Baron Vannis]]
		- [[SEASEC]] moves mercenary forces into the city as invaders
		- The [[Harvord Trading Company]] sends mercantile assets to capitalize on the tragedy 
#### The Black Ghost Hunt
A 5000sp bounty has been placed on a serial murderer.
	- The murders are random
	- The murders of non-Enforcers go unreported
	- The murders occur on in Avalon (eastside Mossburg)
#### The Letters
The party sends letters out to their patrons, requesting payments for a job well done and information on what more to be doing.
	- Paul sends Em a pair of knuckle dusters, 475sp, and a list of 3 minor transport/supply jobs;

```
	Hey Em. I got some brass made for you, which should help some, and your money got here, so take it. And yeah, I know some folks who need some things moved around. You can talk with Sienna Clipwin at the Swift Foot Warehouse if you want to move something legal. She'll probably send you out of town though. You can talk with Jasper otherwise, you'll find him hanging around the western market. Some folks have been talking about rumors of Harvord moving into town, so if you find anyone working for him, get 'em.

	+ 475sp
	+ Knuckle Dusters (unarmed, +1 to hit, +1d4 damage punches)
```
.
	- Avery sends Leliana 500sp, her compliments, and another plan for an anti-Enforcer operation within Mossburg
```
**Operational Debrief**
	Your performance was satisfactory. Your fee has been payed.

	Friendly units have been deployed to reinforce your position. Your support on 7/19 at 1200 hours in the assualt of the eastern gate would be compensated. 

	+ 500sp

**Operational Assignment**
	Enter the Prison under the Garrison. Locate and eliminate the Captain of Imprisonment. Locate Prisoner 6522 within Block B and escort them to the surface. Report your completion within 4 days.

	- Cassindil sends Zesh 450sp and their compliments, alongside information regarding a group of [[Hillkeep Loyalists]] coming to support the Enforcers 
```
	Your comrades thank you. Please find a payment enclosed. You are welcome to return, although your current position with your allies continues to support our standing. Should you choose to stay, be aware that the target of your recent activities have requested assistance from other communities - namely the Dwarven Kingdom Jammu and their Hillkeep Loyalists. Fear no political repercussion resulting from conflict with these groups, you are acting under the banner of SEASEC. Good travels, Zesh.

	+ 450sp
```
.
	- Avery also sends Xenfer 300sp, a vague threat against his family, and her compliments regarding the operation
```
	Your performance was satisfactory. A payment has been enclosed. Continue to comply, and your loved ones will remain safe.

	Glory to SEASEC.

	+ 300sp
```
