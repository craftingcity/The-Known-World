### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had progressed through an ancient city known as Deepreach, a once glorious dwarven settlement now lost to some unknown threat - but you have come to know it all too well. 

Deepreach fell to the Illithid. From whence they came or the context of their arrival are still unknown to you, but the observations you can make in the aftermath suggests an overwhelming defeat for the people of Deepreach. Somehow, perhaps as a final act of humanity, the many doors of Deepreach have been sealed for some time, but since the arrival of the 'Eddies' in [[Forgehome]], and their movements up and into [[Mountain Hall]], the Rot that has been festering within Deepreach has begun to spread.

You volunteered yourselves for this journey, without the knowledge of what you will face, but with the conviction to help the people who were here, who are above you unknowing - to protect the innocent, and vanquish the blight becoming here.

You stood on a film of purple slick that itself grows upon the beautiful stonework of the city. Thickening veins have spread throughout the city, and they all stem from here - inside the architectural wonder that must be the city's capital building. As you came to cross the open courtyard hosting the building, a group of these horrible tenticular things you have come to call the Illithid appeared in the blink of an eye, surrounding you.

Your defense was powerful, so much so that the leader of this group, who spent it's time firing beams of energy from its singular eye, quickly made attempts to retreat into the capital building as the tide of battle turned from surprise to slaughter. 

Thomas - the swiftest among you, though perhaps not the most wise - has rushed forward to re-engage the one-eyed thing as it retreats, even though this will likely leave the rest of you behind by an amount of time that could be deadly. Do you hope to stop him before he enters the building, or join him in his chase?
