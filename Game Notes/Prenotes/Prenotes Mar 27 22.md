Include Grod and Kursk in RP scenes. Separate the party?

Its been 10 days in the Underdark. Its been 4 days since [[Heilich-Muwwoq|New Ammyrain]]. [[Gudeliva]] is sick with Undead Rot, the party has a remedy they purchased from Blyzldwrp the traveling deepgnome which will heal them over some period of weeks. Time the party does not have.

They are heading southwest from N.A. toward [[Ungaethram]]. They will likey find the fungal city [[Ootool]] on their way. We'll get there at the end of today, no matter how far we actually go. 

We're gonna run the three-bandits-in-a-web scene and the kooky necromancer scene. 

The party is awoken by Amashod after a cold and uncomfortable sleep on the stone of this 10ft tunnel. [[Gudeliva]] looks as bad as they did hours ago. What do you do?

After some travel, this arterial joins with a Kings Road that links to [[Ootool]] and then [[Ungaethram]]. It is made of Bloodstone (crit on 19+).

After some travel, the party encounters a lone Chelicerae and its most recent live catch; a group of three "mercenaries".
- Krenzo is a half-duergar fighter/rogue. He is overbearing and speaks for his group. He is doing his best to survive, the any major city is unnacceptable for them. 
- Wyruq, the Grave Presence is a bluescaled dragonborn barbarian/paladin of Certi'Alkior. He is stoic and speaks sternly. He owes his life to Krenzo and would do anything for him. 
- Blug Fpurgz is a kuo-toa magician, though she fights with a blade. She is wary and speaks nervously. She is under Krenzo's thumb, as he genuinely has been her best option for survival for some time, but its clear that she is not an adventurer.

After some time, Krenzo makes his move, and attempts to rob the party during a shift change. Depending on the relationships formed with the other party members, Wyruq and Blug will act accordingly. 

- [ ] Case the crew
- [ ] Find their stash
- [ ] Grab
- [ ] Bolt

After some travel, the party encounters the lair of the kooky necromancer that has been making the undead in the area. KS has stayed mobile, but he travels with his undead entarage - he has a few ghoul that carry his equipment and some Fierstjerren assistants. Definitely gonna try to bolt if the party doesnt sneak up. Definitely gonna recur if the party doesn't end him.
