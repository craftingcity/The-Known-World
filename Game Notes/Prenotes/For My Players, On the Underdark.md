Much of the Underdark is unknown to you. Throughout your life, you've heard much less than whispers of the place - the Great Below, the Shadowlands, the Dug Too Deep - but all you have heard is pain or horror. Few tales of the Underdark end well, and too many do not end.

# Travel
Travel takes much time here, as settlements are spread few and far between. 

You would walk (or ride, if you can afford it) through the rocky tunnels doused in twists, turns, shadows, and danger. 

Finding places to eat, sleep, and do your work are a task each there own in the Underdark. 

Light is your greatest ally and your greatest beacon, for worse and rarely better.

## For Varis
Your experiences in the cells of the slavecarts had you losing track of time. Your were nearly constantly moving, and the darkness of material surrounding the bars of your cage made it near impossible to sense direction. The path was often bumpy and difficult. They made you climb or walk on foot during transit more than once. The climbs were very hard; worse were the beatings when you miss-stepped.

You rarely ate on these journeys. When you did, it was a mush of poor smelling fungi and a fowl powder. You did not eat meat during your service to House Thoulca.

## For Amashod
The rock of this place is special; Alikiear has told you so. Your goblin companion showed you the hopefully unnecessary task of preparing and eating Wormrock, a porous near fleshy kind of stone that can be fried and seasoned with edible mushroom or fungi for an edible meal. They showed you too the brutality of Bloodstone when they ate a troglodyte's neck out in the middle of battle. 

You had heard that they were a collector of shiny things, and bought their trust and assistance with a valuable piece of jewelry.

# Fauna
The creatures here in the Underdark are nothing like the tales; they're worse. You're some tough adventurers, but in the Underdark, your flesh and bone says middle of the food chain.

When hunting, you'll be competing with other humanoids, things that eat bones, giant bugs, and horrorbeasts with big teeth!

## For Varis
During your time working in the lower kitchens, you saw great icechambers filled with the corpses of all manner of creature. Large metal headed beasts and bugs of all kind were the most common creatures you saw in the freezer; the rarities were most exciting however. More than once, but not commonly, you would find the corpse of a scaled humanoid. Your most prominent memory was of a black skinned creature that was still slick with mucus hanging from the meathooks. You could swear that its bulbous head was still staring at you, even though you could find no eyes. 

## For Amashod
As the "Darkranger Mercenaries" of Mariul, Amicus, and Triigon said...

"Your greatest threats are Disease, Madness, and Poison. The beasties here will kill you, but many of them would just as easy feed on your corpse after you've killed yourself."

"Second to that; resource management. Food is easy to find here, its just hard to make sure that it isn't you. You've done a great job of that so far, but again, don't kill yourself."

"Then come the beasties; duergar are the worst. They'll as soon slap a chain around your neck as look at you. A lot of the Drow aren't too friendly either. Too much going on at home. Some of the wild things like Trogs, Goblin, or Bulettes you can just throw some meat at and they'll go away. Some things down here are downright mean though."

They made you read aloud the journal of the woman they were hunting. It was in elvish. They were hunting a bad woman.

# Flora
Much of the Underdark's flora is as deadly as its fauna; chocking vines and poisoned spore blasting mushrooms are of great concern.

## For Varis
You dealt with the plants of this place most when you were taken somewhere for a task; be it mining, collecting, or being used as bait. On one trip, you were given a pickaxe, but you were quickly disarmed by the puff of a fungus and fell unconscious. On another, you would collect red berries in weaved baskets that the other slaves warned you not to try to sneak for dual purpose; not only would you be savagely beaten, but the berries are poisonous, instrumental in the poisons the drow use during assassinations, you shouldn't eat them even if you got away with it. 

## For Amashod

A drow, Vanpeng, helped you identify flora here; in exchange, you helped him with his need for blood.

Lithel / 'Cavern Grass' - While Lithel provides very little food, in the form of its oat-like seeds, it can be dried and used to weave baskets and other helpful containers and objects. It is usually around a foot tall and grows in small, sparse patches. Its color is a dull grey, and its texture is spiny and spindly.

Arnic / Spider Berries - These tiny, red berries look similar to spider eyes. They are very weed-like, and tend to overgrow areas quickly. While they can be eaten, they are somewhat poisonous.

Corpse Moss - This strange plant is plentiful around areas strewn with bones, giving it its name. While some underdark creatures make nests out of it, others won't go anywhere near it. Its revolting stench can be smelled for a few hundred feet. It is not edible, but it makes decent bedding for those who don't mind the smell.

Lace Mycelium - A fungus made up of thin, white filaments. It appears almost web-like, stretching over tiny cracks in walls. It is considered very rare, and is considered a delicacy. Lace mycelium provides a low amount of food, but tastes pleasantly savory.

Giant's Bedroll - This pitcher plant is around eight feet in length, and is frequently found on its lonesome. It provides a lot of food and decent amount of water, though spoils quickly when removed from its vine. When dried, it can be made into a bitter but nutritious powder that keeps for a long time.

Kavep / Red Bean - These beans are highly poisonous, growing in little bunches along ceilings. They are a brownish color, and receive their name because they cause anyone who eats them to cough blood.

Verr Gourd - This large plant grows alone, and tends to be found near water. Its faint orange color drains to brown as it decays. It makes an excellent container for water, holding around 20 ounces. It is too woody to eat.

Fire Lichen - Pale orange-white in color, fire lichen thrives on warmth. Fire lichen can be ground and fermented into a hot, spicy paste, which is often spread on sporebread to give it flavor. Supposedly Duergar ferment fire lichen into a fiercely hot liquor.

Zurkhwood - This giant mushroom can reach a height of 30 to 40 feet. Its large spores are edible with proper preparation, but zurkhwood is important primarily because its stalks are hard and woody. Zurkhwood is one of the very few sources of timber (or anything like it) in the Underdark, and many items that would be crafted from wood in the surface world are fashioned from zurkhwood in the Realms Below.
