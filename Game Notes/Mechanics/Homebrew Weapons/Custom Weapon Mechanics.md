# Weapon Damage Rules Changes
### Bludgeoning
When you miss with an attack that would deal bludgeoning damage, if the attack missed by two or less, you may deal half damage of the attack anyway. 

### Piercing
When you make an attack with a weapon that deals piercing damage, if you have advantage on the attack roll, and you hit with the attack, the attack deals an additional 1d4 damage.

### Slashing
When you hit with an attack that would deal slashing damage, you may choose to reduce the damage of your attack by 1d8 and attempt to apply a stack of Bleed. If you do, the creature hit by this attack must make a Constitution Saving throw, the DC of which is equal to this attack's Attack Roll Total. If they fail, you apply half the value of the value rolled as stacks of Bleed.

At the beginning of a Bleeding creatures turn, they take 1d4 slashing damage per stack of Bleed they have.

A creature may remove all stacks of Bleed from itself by receiving some kind of magical Wound healing ability or spell, or spending a Full Action on their turn to attempt a Profession (Doctor) check, the DC of which is equal to 10 + two times the number of stacks of Bleed the creature has.

# Weapon Tags Changes

If this weapon also has the Ammunition (X) tag, the number displayed in parentheses directly after this tag is the number of ammunitions able to be fired before one must take a Heavy Reload Full Action.

### Very Heavy
A medium creature makes attacks with this weapon at disadvantage.

If this weapon also has the Ammunition (X) tag, the number displayed in parentheses directly after this tag is the number of ammunitions able to be fired before one must take a Heavy Reload Full Action.

### Light
This weapon can be thrown for it's full weapon damage within 15' and half its full damage within 30'. When one attempts such an attack with this weapon, they make the attack roll with disadvantage - while this weapon can be thrown, this weapon is not necessarily solely purposed to do so.

A wielder of this weapon may chose to use their DEX used in place of their STR while making attack and damage rolls with this weapon.

### Quick
A wielder of this weapon gains a +1 bonus to initiative scores while wielding this weapon, and, in the specific case of a tie in the initiative, a wielder gains an effective +2 to their Dex modifier during this comparison.

You do not incur disadvantage while making ranged attacks while an opposing combatant is within 5 feet.

### Versatile (dX)
This weapon can be held in two hands. The dice displayed in the parentheses directly after this tag display the Damage Dice when this weapon is wielded in two hands.

Characters of size categories Large or higher may always use the higher Damage Dice, even when wielding this weapon with one hand.

### Finesse
This weapon is designed to be used by skill rather than force. A weilder's DEX is used in place of their STR while making attack and damage rolls with this weapon.

### Two-Handed
This weapon must be held in two hands to be wielded effectively. If wielded in one hand, any weapon attacks are made with Disadvantage. 

Characters of size categories Large or higher may ignore this restriction.

This weapon is difficult to fight with during a close-quarters combat. When making an attack against a target within five feet of the you, you make the attack with a -2 bonus to the attack roll.

### Stashable

### Thrown
This weapon is designed to be thrown. The first item in the range column is the default range of the weapon. The second item in the range column is the extended range of the weapon; making such a distanced attack puts the attack roll at disadvantage.

### Siege
This weapon is so large or unwieldy that it requires a full action to prepare before it can be used to make any kind of weapon attacks or moved. 

> For clarity, one must use an action in the armory to prepare the siege equipment for movement, then move with it to where they wish to fire, and then there use another action to prepare the equipment for use, and then finally they may begin to attack. Once they wish to move again, this process repeats.

If this weapon is designed to fire some type of ammunition, the number displayed in parentheses directly after this tag is the number of ammunitions able to be fired before one must take a Heavy Reload Full Action.

The first item in the range column is the default range of the weapon. The second item in the range column, if it exists, is the extended range of the weapon; making such a distanced attack puts the attack roll at disadvantage.

While a creature is effected by Sunder, at the beginning of their turn, their Armor Class is reduced by 1. A creature's Armor Class cannot be reduced below 10+DEX this way.

A creature who would be reasonably immune to this effect, likely because they have a Natural Armor or something of the sort, is not effected by Sunder.

### Dismember
Please see the [[#Targeting Table]] below.

As you perform a weapon attack, you may attempt to amputate an exposed organ or limb of a creature. Select a row of the [[#Targeting Table]]. If your attack beats the target's AC + your selection's DC, the part is "removed" and the corresponding effect is applied. 

### Disarm
When you hit with this weapon, you may attempt to disarm your opponent. Make an Athletics or Sleight of Hand check. Your target makes a Dexterity Saving Throw versus the total value of the roll. If they fail, they are disarmed and the object they are holding lands at your feet.

### Sweep
In replacement of a weapon attack, you may swing your weapon in a large arc. Choose a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus that in range of the attack. Then, make a weapon attack against each of them. For any hits made this way, the damage dealt is halved. 

### Assail
As a standard action, you may make a series of small, superficial attacks in an attempt to disorient them. Make an attack roll. Your target makes a Dexterity saving throw versus the total value of the roll. If they fail, their AC is reduced by 4, and they have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity Saving Throws.

While you maintain this Grapple, you cannot use this weapon to make attacks, and you gain an effective +4 to your Athletics for the purposes of maintaining the Grapple.

### Wrap

If you hit with this attack, the attack deals no damage and the target becomes Incapacitated for as long as the weapon remains Wrapped around your target.

An effected target can make a contested Athletics check versus you as an action on their turn in an attempt to remove the weapon from around them. You cannot use this weapon to perform weapon attacks during this time without voluntarily removing the restraint from the target.

### Return
When you miss with an attack with this weapon, it returns to you in an arc. You may recollect this weapon as a part of the weapon attack if you succeed on a DC12 Sleight of Hand check. If you fail this check, the weapon harmlessly lands within 5ft of you.

You may always activate a weapon's Return Special, even if you have already activated it since your most recent rest.

### Pointtack
Please see the [[#Targeting Table]] below.

As you perform a weapon attack, you may attempt to precisely target a part of your target. If your attack beats the target's AC + your selection's DC, the part is severely harmed and the corresponding effect is applied. 

### Scatter
In replacement of a weapon attack, you may create a 10' cone of small, quick, and harmful shot. Roll your weapon's normal damage. Any creatures in the zone make a Dexterity Saving Throw, taking an equal division of the damage on a failure or half that value on a success. 

Any creatures in half cover take half of their share of the damage, and any creatures in three-quarters cover take three-quarters of their share of the damage, and in either case the remaining damage is done to the cover instead.
