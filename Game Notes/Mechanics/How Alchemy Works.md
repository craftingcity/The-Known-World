# What is alchemy?
Alchemy is the process of creating or imparting a consistent magical effect into or onto a material substance.

Often, the finished results are the potions that keep adventurers alive, the tinctures that commoners take to stave off disease, and the trinkets and items that perform specific tasks all around Alaturmen.

# How do I start?
You will need tools to set up your lab. Most alchemists have their own recipes, containers, processes, and the like. No magic is necessary to begin alchemy, but it certainly can make the processes much easier or otherwise replace some steps of a recipe.

## "Alchemist's Tools"


### Philosopher's Stone
Alchemy almost always begins at the Philosopher's stone. A Philosipher's Stone or some of its baser products are a requirement in higher level alchemy. 

Creating such a stone requires "*a spark of life*", "*a powder of wisdom*", and **time**. The vaguer ingredients have led many alchemists to form their own recipes for creating such a work.

Expert Alchemists can create Red Water, and Journeymen can craft Yellow Powder. These two materials are the two forms of Philosopher's Stone. Recipes for creating Philosopher's Stones that bear these ingredients form new Stones much quicker than those without, leading to theoretically exponentially increasing production.
