# Weapon Damage Rules Changes
### Bludgeoning

When you miss with an attack that would deal bludgeoning damage, if the attack missed by two or less, you may deal half damage of the attack anyways.

> This is intended to *simulate* the idea that even when I cannot pierce your armor, a bludgeoning weapon does not necessarily have to.

### Piercing

When you make an attack with a weapon that deals piercing damage, if you have advantage on the attack roll and you hit with the attack, the attack deals an extra 1d4 damage.

### Slashing

When you hit with an attack that would deal slashing damage, you may choose to reduce the damage of your attack by 1d4 to apply a stack of Bleed.

> Bleed deals 1d3 (aka 1d6/2, round up) damage per stack at the beginning of the effected creature's turn.
> Bleed, once applied, can only be removed by way of magical healing (such as a spell or potion of healing) or by spending an action and succeeding on a DC 12 Medicine check 
> This is an explicit clause that either of these two options could be preformed by an ally.

# Weapon Tags Changes
### Heavy

A small creature makes attacks with this weapon with disadvantage.

### Light

This weapon can be thrown for it's full weapon damage within 15' and half it's full damage within 30'. When one attempts such an attack with this weapon, they make the attack roll with disadvantage - while this weapon can be thrown, this weapon is not necessarily solely purposed to do so.

A wielder of this weapon may use their Dex modifier in place of their Str modifier when making weapon attacks with this weapon, if they wish to do so.

### Quick

A wielder of a quick weapon gains a +1 bonus to initiative scores while wielding this weapon, and, in the specific case of a tie in the initiative, a wielder gains an effective +2 to their Dex modifier during this comparison.

### Versatile

This weapon can be held in two hands. The first item in the Weapon Die column shows the damage when wielded with only one hand, while the second displays the damage done while the weapon is wielded in both hands. Switching your blade-holding stance can be done as a free action on your turn so long as you have a free hand.

### Unwieldy

This weapon is difficult to fight with during a close-quarters combat. When making an attack against a target within five feet of the you, you make the attack with a -2 bonus to the attack roll.

### Long

This weapon has a reach of roughly 10 feet, though exactly that much when performing combat calculations.

### Flexible

This weapon can be stored in such a matter that it requires no slots of your carrying capacity to do so.

### Thrown

This weapon is designed to be thrown. The first item in the range column is the default range of the weapon. The second item in the range column is the extended range of the weapon; making such a distanced attack puts the attack roll at disadvantage.

### Ranged

This weapon is designed to fire some type of ammunition. The first item in the range column is the default range of the weapon. The second item in the range column is the extended range of the weapon; making such a distanced attack puts the attack roll at disadvantage.

### Siege

This weapon is so large or unwieldy that it requires a full action to prepare before it can be used to make any kind of weapon attacks. It must be re-prepared after moving.

### Wind-Susceptible

This area of affect can be effectively dispersed by a medium wind or a sustained (1 minute) light wind.

### Ignitable

This area of affect can be ignited by a spark or open flame. If such a thing were to occur, any occupants of the area would immediately take 6d4 fire damage, and the area of affect becomes dispersed and/or innert.

### Metal-Attunement

This weapon is specifically attuned, somehow, to metal, and solely metal. This weapon has no effect against items that are not metal and creatures that are not holding, wearing, or otherwise touching the targeted metal.

# Weapon Specials
### Bash
### Pummel
### En-Route
### Pin

In replacement of a weapon attack, you can attempt to pin a target to an abject using this weapon. Make this attempt as if it were a normal weapon attack; your attack bonus versus your target's AC. If you hit with this attack, the attack deals no damage and the target becomes restrained for as long as the weapon remains in the target's armor/clothing.

An effected target can make a contested Athletics check versus you as an action on their turn in an attempt to remove the weapon from your pinning position. You cannot use this weapon to perform weapon attacks during this time without voluntarily removing the pin.

### Charge

When you make a weapon attack with this weapon, if you have moved 10 or more feet from your starting position this turn, you may gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll and, if you hit, the damage roll.

### Sunder

When you hit with an attack with this weapon, if you beat your target's AC by five or more, you may choose to reduce the damage of your attack by 1d8 and apply a stack of Sunder.

> Sunder reduces the effected creature's effective AC by 1 per stack.
> Sunder targets the creature's armor, not their natural ability to dodge or withstand damage.
> Creatures' armor class cannot be reduced below 10 + their Dex modifier, and magic or natural armors are immune to this affect.

### Amputate
Please see the [[#Targeting Table]] below.

As you perform a weapon attack, you may attempt to amputate an exposed organ or part of a creature. Select a row of the [[#Targeting Table]]. If your attack beats the target's AC + your selection's 

### Sweep
### Cross-Lock Grab

As a reaction, when you are attacked by a creature within 5 feet, you may perform a contested Athletics check against your attacker. If you succeed, you take no damage from the triggering attack, and the attacker is grappled. While you maintain this grapple, you cannot use your weapon to make attacks, and you gain an effective +4 to your Athletics.

### Wrap

As you perform a weapon attack, you may attempt to restrain your target.  

### Return
### Pointtack

As you perform a weapon attack, you may attempt to precisely target your weapon. 
### Scatter

In replacement of a weapon attack, you may create a 10' cone of small, quick, and harmful pellets. Roll your weapon's normal damage. Any creatures in the zone take an equal division of the damage. Any creatures in half cover take half of their share of the damage, and any creatures in three-quarters cover take three-quarters of their share of the damage, and in either case the remaining damage is done to the cover instead.
