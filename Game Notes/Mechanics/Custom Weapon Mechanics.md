# Weapon Damage Rules Changes
### Bludgeoning

When you miss with an attack that would deal bludgeoning damage, if the attack missed by two or less, you may deal half damage of the attack anyways.

This is intended to *simulate* the idea that even when I cannot pierce your armor, a bludgeoning weapon does not necessarily have to.

### Piercing

When you make an attack with a weapon that deals piercing damage, if you have advantage on the attack roll and you hit with the attack, the attack deals an extra 1d4 damage.

### Slashing

When you hit with an attack that would deal slashing damage, you may choose to reduce the damage of your attack by 1d4 to apply a stack of Bleed.

> Bleed deals 1d3 (aka 1d6/2, round up) damage per stack at the beginning of the effected's turn.
> Bleed, once applied, can only be removed by way of magical healing (such as a spell or potion of healing).
