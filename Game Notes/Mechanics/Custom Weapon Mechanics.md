# Weapon Damage Rules Changes
### Bludgeoning

When you miss with an attack that would deal bludgeoning damage, if the attack missed by two or less, you may deal half damage of the attack anyways.

This is intended to *simulate* the idea that even when I cannot pierce your armor, a bludgeoning weapon does not necessarily have to.

### Piercing

When you make an attack with a weapon that deals piercing damage, if you have advantage on the attack roll and you hit with the attack, the attack deals an extra 1d4 damage.

### Slashing

When you hit with an attack that would deal slashing damage, you may choose to reduce the damage of your attack by 1d4 to apply a stack of Bleed.

> Bleed deals 1d3 (aka 1d6/2, round up) damage per stack at the beginning of the effected's turn.
> Bleed, once applied, can only be removed by way of magical healing (such as a spell or potion of healing).

# Weapon Tags Changes
### Heavy

A small creature makes attacks with this weapon with disadvantage.

### Light

This weapon can be thrown for it's full weapon damage within 15' and half it's full damage within 30'. When one attempts such an attack with this weapon, they make the attack roll with disadvantage - while this weapon can be thrown, this weapon is not solely purposed to do so.

A wielder of this weapon may use their Dex modifier in place of their Str when making weapon attacks with this weapon, if they wish to do so.

### Quick

A wielder of a quick weapon gains a +1 bonus to initiative scores while wielding this weapon, and, in the specific case of a tie in the initiative, a wielder gains an effective +2 to their Dex modifier during this comparison.

### Versatile

This weapon can be held in two hands. The first item in the Weapon Die column shows the damage when wielded with only one hand, while the second displays the damage done while the weapon is wielded in both hands. Switching your blade-holding stance can be done as a free action on your turn so long as you have a free hand.

### Unwieldy

This weapon is difficult to fight with during a close-quarters combat. When making an attack against a target within five feet of the wielder, they make the attack with a -2 bonus to the attack roll.

### Long

This weapon has a reach of roughly 10 feet, though exactly that much when performing combat calculations.

### Flexible

This weapon can be stored in such a matter that it requires no slots of your carrying capacity to do so.

### Thrown

This weapon is designed to be thrown.
