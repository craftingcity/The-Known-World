# Weapon Damage Rules Changes
### Bludgeoning

When you miss an attack that would deal bludgeoning damage, if the attack missed by two or less, you may deal half damage of the attack anyways.

This is intended to *simulate* the idea that even when I cannot pierce your armor, a bludgeoning weapon does not necessarily have to.

### Piercing

When you hit with an attack that deals piercing damage
