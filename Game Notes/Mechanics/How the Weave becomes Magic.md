The essence of the world is a hyper mutable material latent in all things, given the name Weave. This name stems from the multiverse's great creation legend; the trio of Weavers who created the multiverse from their own essence, weaving together reality itself.

In everything, there is the Weave.

# Elemental
When the first beings began to create, the Elements came before all else. The four elemental planes burst with energy, waiting for something to channel into. Those mortals that hold power granted by these forces are known as Druids and Rangers.

# Fey
The first inhabited planes know magic as the creative force of will of their superiors. This style of magic is creative, and some theories claim that it is how the Weave was fabricated in the first place. Those mortals that hold power granted by these forces are known as Bards or Trickster-Rouges.

# Divine
As the people of the multiverse came together, they produced Faith, and delivered it unto their own Gods, manipulating the Weave to form these new beings of Faith. Those mortals that hold power granted by these forces are known as Clerics, Warlocks, and Paladins.

Clerics bind themselves with their worship, exchanging their now amplified Faith for their God's divine intervention.

Warlocks bind themselves with their purchase, exchanging something of value, such as a portion or whole of the Soul, the densest form Faith can take.

Paladins bind themselves to their Oath. A paladin has the upmost Faith in their Oath, and to a God, this is nearly as dense a form of Faith as the Soul.

# Arcane
The Weave Arcane is the method by which many mortals manually manipulate the Weave itself. These mortals are known as Mages, a title which itself could be subdivided further into those who have learned to master the methods of the Weave Arcane, known as Wizards, and those who somehow access the Weave Arcane by methods they do not fully understand, known as Sorcerers or Eldritch Knights.
