# Alchemy!
## Introducing Alchemy
Alchemy is the act of harnessing the latent magical energy in all things known as "Weave Potentia". When this energy is harnessed, it will affect the world around it, or sometimes produce an effect known as "Weave Arcane", an invoked and (ideally) purposed manifestation of this energy. This involves some chemical processes, some magical processes, and a very cryptic and loose set of hard laws.

### Grades
For the purposes of gamifying this conceptual system into one you can play with, the quality of an alchemical product is given a Grade. The Grades, as presented lowest to highest, are Apprentice, Novice, Journeym'n, Expert, and Master. 

### Schools
It is true that most alchemists find success in creating their own formula, but many alchemists create formula that are only de-facto unique, and throughout these "common" formula, certain schools of thought begin to emerge. Three broad "schools" of Alchemy emerge from these patterns, using similar components, equipment, and processes.

#### Elemental
Durandurm's ability to invoke elemental power has led to its use in many formula and labratory across Alaturmen. By harnessing the powers of the most basic Elements, one could manipulate the Weave to their will.

#### Draconic
A rare school of alchemy that is generally only practiced by the dragon-kin themselves that involves using physical aspects of the body of a dragon-kin as potent components in alchemy.

#### Necrotic


### How do *I* start doing Alchemy?

#### Philosopher's Stone
Alchemy begins at the Philosopher's Stone. The collected energy in such an object is so great that it effects other objects it is exposed to. Alchemical formula will often involve touching, submerging, wrapping, or otherwise contacting the stone or one of its subsidiary products - Red Water and Yellow Powder. These two are lesser forms of the stone, Yellow Powder more-so than Red Water, regularly replace the Stone in alchemical formula.

##### Creating a Stone
A Philosopher's Stone can be created by following these cryptic instructions;

"Creating such a work requires a *spark of life*, a *powder of wisdom*, and *much time*, but it could be done."

Many alchemists have created their own formula for creating a Philosopher's Stone and debate the potency of one ingredient over another, but there is no discernible difference â€“ when a Philospher's Stone is created, it has no Grade. Those formula that involve Yellow Powder, Red Water, or another Philospher's Stone produce more quickly than those formula without - such a "virgin" stone takes just over a century to form.

#### Basic Kit
There are four tools that are considered integral in the Alchemist's kit. The first is the Mortar and Pestle, used for mixing and grinding ingredients into powders or pastes. Second, the Calcinator, a heat-proof container used for indirect heat processes. Third and Fourth are the Alembic and Retort, which are used for wet and dry distillation respectively.

These tools can be made small and portable enough that they can be brought along as equipment during adventures or mobile laboratories. If this process is done poorly, it could damage the equipment's ability to produce high-grade products.

#### Permanent Lab
Okay, so you want to set up a permanent lab. Okay. Do it. There is no guideline for what this looks like, take what you know and try some stuff. 

A permanent lab can grow and shrink to the needs of an alchemist, but anything more than a Basic Kit will need a permanent housing.

### Mechanics
#### Production
The act of creating an alchemical product by a player is both an in-game performance that include collecting ingredients, equipment, knowledge, and creativity, as well as a roll of Intelligence (Arcana / Alchemist's Tools) for mechanical effect. 

When this check is performed during downtime, or by an NPC, one would "take ten", and calculate as though they had rolled a ten on the die.

30+ | Master
25-29| Expert
18-24 | Journeym'n
13-17 | Novice
8-12 | Apprentice
(+8, nonstacking) | Using a Philosopher's Stone
(+4, nonstacking) | Using some Red Water
(+2, nonstacking) | Using some Yellow Powder
(+0-4, once) | Using an alchemically potent ingredient

#### Collection
Collecting ingredients that are alchemically potent is a task that involves correctly identifying and harvesting such an ingredient. For the purposes of our game this will involve a Wisdom (Survival) check against the following table. Quantity must be considered as appropriate to in-game truths, such as time, weight, availability, etc.
