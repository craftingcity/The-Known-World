This involves some chemical processes, some magical processes, and a very cryptic and loose set of hard laws.

### Grades
For the purposes of gamifying this conceptual system into one you can play with, the quality of an alchemical product is given a Grade. The Grades, as presented lowest to highest, are Apprentice, Novice, Journeym'n, Expert, and Master.

A permanent lab can grow and shrink to the needs of an alchemist, but anything more than the Alchemist's Tools needs a permanent housing.
