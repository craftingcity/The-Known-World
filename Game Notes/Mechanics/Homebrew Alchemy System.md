# Alchemy!
I will be referencing the living documents of ``AlchemicalProduct.ods`` and ``AlchemicalComponent.ods`` present in [[Here lie my suppliments...]]; they contain details of the items discussed herein.

## Introducing Alchemy
Alchemy is the act of harnessing the latent magical energy in all things known as "Weave Potentia". When this energy is harnessed, it will affect the world around it, or sometimes produce an effect known as "Weave Arcane", an invoked and (ideally) purposed manifestation of this energy. This involves some chemical processes, some magical processes, and a very cryptic and loose set of hard laws.

### Grades
For the purposes of gamifying this conceptual system into one you can play with, the quality of an alchemical product is given a Grade. The Grades, as presented lowest to highest, are Apprentice, Novice, Journeym'n, Expert, and Master. 

### Schools

### How do *I* start doing Alchemy?
#### Philosopher's Stone
Alchemy begins at the Philosopher's Stone. The collected energy in such an object is so great that it effects other objects it is exposed to. Alchemical formula will often involve touching, submerging, wrapping, or otherwise contacting the stone or one of its subsidiary products - Red Water and Yellow Powder. These two are lesser forms of the stone, Yellow Powder moreso than Red Water, often replacing the Stone in a formula.

##### Creating a Stone
A Philosopher's Stone can be created by following these cryptic instructions;

"Creating such a work requires a *spark of life*, a *powder of wisdom*, and *much time*, but it could be done."

Many alchemists have created their own formula for creating a Philosopher's Stone and debate the potency of one ingredient over another, but there is no discernible difference â€“ when a Philospher's Stone is created, it has no Grade. Those formula that involve Yellow Powder, Red Water, or another Philospher's Stone produce more quickly than those formula without - such a "virgin" stone takes just over a century to form.

#### Basic Kit
There are four tools that are considered integral in the Alchemist's kit. The first is the Mortar and Pestle, used for mixing and grinding ingredients into powders or pastes. Second, the Calcinator, a heat-proof container used for indirect heat processes. Third and Fourth are the Alembic and Retort, which are used for wet and dry distillation respectively.

These tools can be made small and portable enough that they can be brought along as equipment during adventures or mobile laboratories. If this process is done poorly, it could damage the equipment's ability to produce high-grade products.

#### Permanent Lab
Okay, so you want to set up a permanent lab. Okay. Do it. There is no guideline for what this looks like, take what you know and try some stuff. 

A permanent lab can grow and shrink to the needs of an alchemist, but anything more than the Alchemist's Tools needs a permanent housing.
