# Mechanics of a Character
## A. Ability Scores
During play, your character be making attempts to reach their goal, and their successes or failures will most likely be of their own decisions and abilities. Your character's basest abilities are numerically represented by seven values. These seven Ability Scores will influence how well a character will perform at certain actions and are used to qualify for certain features.

An abnormally average character would have four zeros and three negative ones spread across the seven scores (e.g. -1, 0, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0). When creating a new character for a campaign, as these are the most extraordinary people in the setting, will begin with their GM's choice of a "standard array" or a "point buy" experience - either of which will be slightly more powerful than this average character.

##### "Standard Array"
RHOD's "standard array" is the following seven values spread across the seven scores as you wish; (-2), (-1), (+0), (+0), (+1), (+1), (+2).

##### "Point Buy"
RHOD's "point buy" system works as follows; You may spend 14 points. Each of your character's seven ability scores begin at negative two (-2) and can be increased by one for one point, up to a total value of plus four (+4). A possible "point but" stat array may look as follows; (-2), (-2), (-1), (+0), (+0), (+3), (+4).

#### Strength
Strength represents your character's ability to physically maneuver against the will of their opposition. Strength is important for melee fighters.

A character's Strength Score will influence their ability to carry **Equipment** (as discussed in *4X. PLACEHOLDER FOR CHAPTER SUBTITLE*); stronger characters carry more than weaker characters of a similar size.

#### Dexterity
Dexterity represents your character's agility, speed, and reaction time. Dexterity is important for both melee and ranged fighters.

A character's Dexterity Score will influence their **Order During an Encounter** (as discussed in *1C. Phases of Play*); characters who are more Dexterous will very often go before characters who are less Dexterous.

#### Constitution
Constitution represents your character's physical toughness and heartiness. Constitution is important for everyone. Nobody enjoys dying.

A character's Constitution Score will influence their **Vitality** (as discussed in *2B. Defenses*); characters with more Constitution will live longer.

#### Intelligence
Intelligence represents your character's learned experience - their memory retention and the contents of those memories. Intelligence is important for learned spellcasters.

A character's Intelligence Score will influence any and all *Knowledge* or *Profession* Skill Checks (as discussed in *2C. Skills*), and is a key attribute in a character's *Mental* Defense (as discussed in *2B. Defenses*).

#### Charisma
