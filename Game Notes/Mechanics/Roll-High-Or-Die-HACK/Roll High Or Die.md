# Foreword
Roll High or Die is a tabletop role-playing heavily inspired by 5th Edition gaming, the GURPS system, Vampore the Masqurade, and modern "hardcore" video-games like Tarkov, Stalker, or Soulsborne titles.

I began this project as a youngster after I found myself disgruntled with the at-the-time current edition of your favorite nerd's favorite roleplaying game. They - in my eyes - knocked it out of the park on their last one. As I played other games, I started to understand why I liked what a lot of others didn't, and why I didn't  like this return to form that so many others seemed to praise.

And so I will do unto others as has been done unto me. Now, Roll High or Die.
