# Foreword
Roll High or Die (RHOD) is a tabletop role-playing system heavily inspired by 5th Edition gaming, the GURPS system, Vampire the Masquerade, and modern "hardcore" video-games like Tarkov, Stalker, or Soulsborne titles. Ideally, this is an immersive and complex realism-sandbox experience balanced against paperwork bloat and a fun game.

I began this project as a youngster when I found myself disgruntled with the at-the-time current edition of your favorite nerd's favorite role-playing game. They - in my eyes - knocked it out of the park on their last one, which I had grown up on. As I played other games, I started to understand why I liked what a lot of others didn't, and why I didn't like this return to form that so many others seemed to praise.

And so I will do unto others as has been done unto me. 

Now, ***Roll High or Die***.
