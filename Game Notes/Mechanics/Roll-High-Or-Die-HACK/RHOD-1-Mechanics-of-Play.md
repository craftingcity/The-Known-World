# Mechanics of Play
## Playing a Modern Roleplaying Game

Most players will take the role of the "Player Characters" (PCs), and will be the main focus of the narrative camera. One (or more, if you'd like) other player(s) will take the role of the Keeper of Secrets, Master of Game Ceremonies, or Referee (GM), who will act as the camera themselves, as well as the setting, extra actors, and final arbiter for the game rules.

The basic "gameplay loop" begins when the GM describes a scene. 

The players react to the GM's descriptions, balancing their desires for the story they want to tell with their character's realities, and respond with their choice of narration; your choice of a third person narration of your character's next actions or a first person narration of your character's actions (e.g. "Gringold moves to the corpse and screams over his fallen comrade." or "I move towards Harrion's corpse. Seeing his lifeless form, I cannot help but scream in rage." Either style is acceptable and encouraged.).

The GM then responds to the PCs actions, interprets them in both the mechanics of the game and the flow of the storyline, and then continues to describe the scene's reality.

This continues ad infenitum; once you find a narratively satisfying place to stop, or succumb to physical exhaustion, simply cease the loop with a GM's final description, to which the players will return to.

## Playing Roll High Or Die

In RHOD, your narrative will be influenced by the mechanics you use from this game. This is intentional. This game is built to support games that focus on the *survival* and interesting daily life of a small group of people in a *dangerous and beautifully anomalous* world. 

Magic is likely a part of at least a small population's daily life - if it is not necessary to the survival of a culture or group of people. Combat, and by extension Death, fills a similar role. Your players will encounter all three during a prolonged campaign of RHOD.

Most modern RPGs use dice, and RHOD is no different. You will need a full set of polyhedral dice (a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and a d4), and it is likely that you will wish to use multiple of these dice at once. Acquiring multiple sets of dice is encouraged.

When a player takes an action, if there is a measure of random chance or a reasonable possibility of execution failure, that player will roll a d20 and add any relevant modifiers. The consequences, be they positive or negative, will be described by the GM as they compare the player's final total for the action against their interpreted Difficulty Class (DC) for that action given the context of the character's situation.

## Generic Rulings
### Manipulating the Dice
#### Advantage & Disadvantage
When you have Advantage on a roll, you will roll twice and take the higher of the two results. When you have Disadvantage, the opposite is true; you roll twice and take the lower of the two results.

On a d20, this averages to a +5 or -5 modifier.

#### "Meets it Beats it"
When a total exactly meets a DC, but does not exceed it, the player who rolled to beat the DC does succeed, and any mechanical benefits of doing so are granted as per usual.
