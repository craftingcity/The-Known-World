# Mechanics of Play
## Playing a modern Role-playing Game

Most players will take the role of the "Player Characters" (PCs), and will be the main focus of the narrative camera. One (or more, if you'd like) other player(s) will take the role of the Keeper of Secrets, Master of Game Ceremonies, or Referee (GM), who will act as the camera themselves, as well as the setting, extra actors, and final arbiter for the game rules.

The basic "gameplay loop" begins when the GM describes a scene. 

The players then react to the descriptions, balancing their desires with their character's realities, and respond with their choice of a third person narration of their character's next actions or a first person narration of their character's actions (e.g. "Gringold moves to the corpse and screams over his fallen comrade." or "I move towards Harrion's corpse. Seeing his lifeless form, I cannot help but scream in rage."). Either style is acceptable and encouraged. 

The GM then responds to the PCs actions, interprets them, and continues to describe the scene's reality. This continues ad infenitum; once you find a narratively satisfying place to stop, or succumb to physical exhaustion, simply cease the loop with a GM's final description, to which the players will return to.
