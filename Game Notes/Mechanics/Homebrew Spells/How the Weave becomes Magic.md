# The Weave...

The essence of the world is a hyper mutable material latent in all things, given the name Weave. This name stems from the multiverse's great creation legend; the trio of Weavers who created the multiverse from their own essence, weaving together reality itself.

In everything, there is the Weave.

## Elemental ([[Primordial (language)]])
When the first beings began to create, the Elements came before all else. The four elemental planes burst with energy, waiting for something to channel into. Those mortals that hold power granted by these forces are known as **Druids** and **Rangers**. 

Where the **Druids** have sworn themselves wholly and Faith-fully to an Element and form Circles with their peers, **Rangers** harness the power of *all* Elements through their Faith in Nature.

## Fey ([[Sylvan (language)]])
The people of the first inhabited planes know magic as the force of will of their superiors. This style of magic is *creative*, or *mischievous* if you prefer, and some theories claim that it is how the Weave was fabricated in the first place - that this magic is older than the [[#Elemental Primordial language]]. Those mortals that hold power granted by these forces are known as **Bards** or *Trickster*-**Rouges**.

## Divine ([[Celestial (language)]])
As the *people* of the multiverse came together, they produced Faith, and delivered it unto their own Gods, manipulating the Weave to form these new beings of their Faith. Those mortals that hold power granted by these forces are known as **Clerics**, **Warlocks**, and **Paladins**. 

**Clerics** bind themselves by their worship, and in doing so devote themselves entirely to one God, exchanging their attuned Faith for their God's divine interventions and magics. 

**Warlocks** bind themselves by their Purchase, exchanging *something* of value in exchange for some magical ability or alignment. It is very typical for this *something* to be a whole or portion of the **Warlock**'s Soul upon their demise. 

**Paladins** bind themselves with their Oath. A **Paladin** has the upmost Faith in their Oath, and to a God, this is nearly as dense a form of Faith as the Soul. 

Unlike a **Cleric**'s consistent delivery of Faith, a **Warlock**'s Purchase and a **Paladin**'s Oath is a *stock* of Faith - a set amount that could be traded in exchange for some other boon. Rarely is this done, an Oath or a Soul are only slightly less satisfying than Faith drip-fed, and this is most commonly when an Entity cannot bear such a stock, for preference, station, or otherwise.

## Arcane [[Draconic (language)]]
The Weave Arcane is the method by which mortals manually manipulate the Weave itself. These mortals are known as Mages, a title which itself could be subdivided further into those who have learned to master the [[The Axioms, Theories, and Philosophies of Mages of the First Century]], known as **Wizards**, **Artificers** or *Eldritch Knights*, and those who somehow access or invoke the Weave Arcane by methods they could not fully understand, known as **Sorcerers**.
