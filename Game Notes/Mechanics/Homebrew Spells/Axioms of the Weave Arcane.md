# The Axioms of the Weave Arcane
1. **Conservationem Potentiale**
	- Known as the Axiom of Conservation, this axiom holds that Weave, in all forms, cannot be destroyed or created, only ever changed.
2. **Continua Fluxus**
	- Known as the Axiom of Continuity, this axiom holds that the Weave is in constant motion, flowing through all reality. 
3. **Fila Texere**
	- Known as the Axiom of Strands, this axiom holds that the Weave becomes shredded to strands against itself, which we perceive as observable reality as it flows through reality. 
	- The concept of "Weave Potentia", as described in many alchemical texts, is derived from this axiom.
4. **Sutura Novum Significatio**
	- Known as the Axiom of Meaning, this axiom holds that one can manipulate the Strands described by Fila Texere and "sew new meaning", or create purposed effects from these Strands. 
5. **Nodum Inuocationem**
	- Known as the Axiom of Knots, this axiom holds that the Weave invokes "super-natural" or "naturally disruptive" effects when a Knot is created or released in the Weave or it's Strands.
6. **Density Exponentialibus**
	- Known as the Axiom of Density, this axiom holds that there is no theoretical limit on the density of a Knot of Weave, other than the ability of the manipulator to maintain the hold on the Knot as it becomes denser and denser.
