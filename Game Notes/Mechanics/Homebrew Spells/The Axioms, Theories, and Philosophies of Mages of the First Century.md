# Axioms of the Weave Arcane
1. **Conservationem Potentiale**
	- Known as the Axiom of Conservation, this axiom holds that Weave, in all forms, cannot be destroyed or created, only ever changed.
2. **Continua Fluxus**
	- Known as the Axiom of Continuity, this axiom holds that the Weave is in constant motion, flowing through all reality. 
	- Mortals experience this axiom as the passage of time!
3. **Fila Texere**
	- Known as the Axiom of Strands, this axiom holds that the Weave becomes shredded to strands against itself, which we perceive as observable reality as it flows through reality. 
	- The concept of "Weave Potentia", as described in many alchemical texts, is derived from this axiom.
4. **Sutura Novum Significatio**
	- Known as the Axiom of Meaning, this axiom holds that one can manipulate the Strands described by Fila Texere and "sew new meaning" or create purposed effects from these Strands. 
5. **Nodum Inuocationem**
	- Known as the Axiom of Knots, this axiom holds that the Weave invokes "super-natural", "naturally disruptive", or "magical" effects when a Knot is created *or* released in the Weave.
6. **Density Exponentialibus**
	- Known as the Axiom of Density, this axiom holds that there is no theoretical limit on the density of a Knot in the Weave, only the practical ability to apply the force necessary to maintain the Knot as it becomes denser.

## The Theory of Alchemy
To understand Alchemy at all, one must first understand the [[#Axioms of the Weave Arcane]]. After that, we can begin to speak about the Theory of Potential, or, more properly named, the Turring-Turring Theory. Again, after that, the theory of Alchemy continues to expand with Gunagido-Barrowinch Theory and their Motifs of Alchemy.

### Turring-Turring Theory / Theory of Potential
The Turring-Turring Theory was first published in "[[Natural Wonders of a Woven Reality]]", a thin booklet written in 062AF by [[Waywalket Turring]] and [[Dimble Turring]]. This theory builds on the [[#Axioms of the Weave Arcane]] presented and proven in [[The Texts Druidic]], and postulates the following;

> Given the Axiom of Conservation and the Axiom of Continuity, one *must* wonder, if the Weave flows through all things, and can only ever be changed, doesn't this suggest that all things have the Weave flowing through them? As Axiom of Strands seems to directly state this, we could then further theorize that our observable reality *is* some type of Knot, as described in the Axiom of Knots, yet the Axiom of Knots excludes the possibility of the participation of the natural world in this "magic"; only the "naturally-disruptive" effects are the work of a Knot. 
> 
> One could then suggest that our observable reality is perhaps the work of a Knot unmade, but this suggestion *requires* the parallel suggestion that some force failed to maintain a Knot of such a Density that **Alaturmen** was formed. A Tetrimocal view of the world agrees with this suggestion; 'twas the work of Tetrimoc's fall, but this cannot be proven with any known works, including the *Diary of Tetrimoc*. 
> 
> Not only are the specifics of the Axioms a mess of contradiction, but the concept of invocation being a non-natural is provably false. The recipes following this chapter will describe to you the processes by which an arcane invocation of the Weave can be created. While it is clear that some effects could be enhanced with more specialized equipment, we suggest only four pieces in this book that we believe to be integral to an expanding toolkit of this practice, and we have also included one recipe that requires no specialized tools at all, though the effect when produced in this manner is quite minor.

### Gunagido-Barrowinch Theory
The Gunagido-Barrowinch Theory, also known as the the Motifs of Alchemy, describes twenty-nine "motifs" that are connected, mutable, and present in most if not all alchemically potent ingredients that one would encounter in . 

While this theory has yet to be popularized (or, in cannon, written down in one place), those few who have become Experts in this field almost unanimously agree that a dual categorization of alchemical ingredients is "efficient" or even "correct".
