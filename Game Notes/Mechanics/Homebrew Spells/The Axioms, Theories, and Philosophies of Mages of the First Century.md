# Axioms of the Weave Arcane
1. **Conservationem Potentiale**
	- Known as the Axiom of Conservation, this axiom holds that Weave, in all forms, cannot be destroyed or created, only ever changed.
2. **Continua Fluxus**
	- Known as the Axiom of Continuity, this axiom holds that the Weave is in constant motion, flowing through all reality. 
3. **Fila Texere**
	- Known as the Axiom of Strands, this axiom holds that the Weave becomes shredded to strands against itself, which we perceive as observable reality as it flows through reality. 
	- The concept of "Weave Potentia", as described in many alchemical texts, is derived from this axiom.
4. **Sutura Novum Significatio**
	- Known as the Axiom of Meaning, this axiom holds that one can manipulate the Strands described by Fila Texere and "sew new meaning", or create purposed effects from these Strands. 
5. **Nodum Inuocationem**
	- Known as the Axiom of Knots, this axiom holds that the Weave invokes "super-natural", "naturally disruptive", or "magical" effects when a Knot is created *or* released in the Weave.
6. **Density Exponentialibus**
	- Known as the Axiom of Density, this axiom holds that there is no theoretical limit on the density of a Knot in the Weave, only the practical ability to apply the force necessary to maintain the Knot as it becomes denser.

To understand Alchemy at all, one must first understand **Continua Fluxus**. After that, we can begin to speak about the Basics of Alchemy, or, more properly named, the Turring-Turring Theory. 

The Turring-Turring Theory was first published in "Natural Wonders of a Woven Reality", a thin booklet written by [[Waywalket Turring]] and [[Dimble Turring]] that postulates the following:
