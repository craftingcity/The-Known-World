## Cantrips
### Damaging Cantrips
#### Fire Bolt / Eldritch Blast
Fire Bolt is what I want in a damage-role cantrip when I cant have Eldritch Blast & it's Invocations.

#### Frostbite / Mind Sliver / Vicious Mockery
Frostbite is a perfect example of what I want my damage-debuff-role cantrips to look like.

#### Sword Burst / Word of Radiance
I think that AOE on a cantrip is quite powerful, but if I don't adjust the damage dice at all, these look much more acceptable to me.

#### Thorn Whip / Lightning Lure
Players often want to use this to assist their allies, so I wanna bake that in somehow, even if its just an explicit clause in the description of the spell regarding using this on allies. Otherwise, these are fun combat tools.
