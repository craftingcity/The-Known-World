## "Bastion" Spells
The following spells I consider either beacons of balance or imbalance for their role, and will be basing the spell-building system on their (tweaked for new vitality) balance, or spells that fufill an archetype that I wish to represent well in my hack.

### Damaging Cantrips
#### Fire Bolt / Eldritch Blast
Fire Bolt is what I want in a damage-role cantrip when I cant have Eldritch Blast & it's Invocations.

#### Frostbite
Frostbite is a perfect example of what I want my damage-debuff-role cantrips to look like.

#### Sword Burst / Word of Radiance
I think that AOE on a cantrip is quite powerful, but if I don't adjust the damage dice at all, these look much more acceptable to me.

#### Thorn Whip / Lightning Lure
Players often want to use this to assist their allies, so I wanna bake that in somehow, even if its just an explicit clause in the description of the spell regarding using this on allies. Otherwise, these are fun combat tools.

### Buffing Cantrips
#### Blade Ward
#### Guidance
#### Magic Stone
#### Resistance
#### Shillelagh
#### True Strike

### Utility Cantrips
