# Strength As Carrying Capacity
A character cannot reasonably loot the contents of a horde onto their person and function at the same capacity in combat or otherwise as they would before. Perhaps it weighs too much, or is too unwieldy to carry all of. Adventure sometimes means leaving something behind.

Strength As Carrying Capacity is a Slot based system. A character has a number of Carry Capacity slots equal to four plus their Strength Score. A character becomes *Encumbered* when half or more of their Carrying Capacity is occupied. A character becomes *Over-encumbered* when all of their Carrying Capacity is occupied.

Every instance of an item requires its own Carrying Capacity slot unless that item is *Stackable*. Items that are *Stackable* can occupy the same slot up to 20 times. The majority of Coinage, Components, Supplies, or Ammunition are *Stackable* items. Weapons and Armor are never *Stackable*.

### Encumbrance

When a character is *Encumbered*, their Speed is reduced by 10.

When a character is *Over-encumbered*, their Speed is reduced by 20, and they have Disadvantage on Dexterity and Strength Saving Throws.

### Character Size

A *Small* character's Carrying Capacity is equal to their Strength Score.

A *Large* character's Carrying Capacity is equal to eight plus their Strength Score.
