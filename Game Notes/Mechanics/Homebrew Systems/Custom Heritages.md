## Dwarven
## Elven

People with a heavy Elven heritage find themselves in possession of preternatural abilities heavily related to the Feywild. The origins of Elven people are largely common information - they are the childer of the Eladrin, a rank of noble of the Ceelie Courts, purposefully born to take Alaturmen for the Ceelie. This plan was derailed in the Great Fires, and the beginnings of a grand elven empire lay now bare in the Holyl'nd.

- You do not age as mortals do. You reach adulthood after your first great achievement, which of course you will feel in yourself. You will, after many many years - though how many is quite uncertain, feel the urge, nay, the need to wander North, farther than you have gone before. Farther than the Wildlands would allow you. A deep homesickness will beset you, and it is quite likely that you will never return.
