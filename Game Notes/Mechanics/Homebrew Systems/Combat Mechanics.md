# Roll Hie. Or Die.
It is my intention to hack the current 5e system of HP, Hit Die, AC, and Death Saves as a complete representation of a character's "health" into something akin to VtM's "superficial wounds" & "mortal wounds" or Darkes Dungeon's Death's Door, that also maybe lets me play with higher damages for my "normal" weapons.

## Vitality
A character's ability to "tank", dodge, parry, block, evade, or otherwise *not fully ef'n die from* (because remember, ***that's the goal*** when you swing a sword at someone or shoot a fire bolt at their dome) is known as their Vitality. 

> A character's AC is based on the armor that their wearing and maybe their Dex mod, like og5e. We make weapon attacks vs this number, like og5e.

This is equal to a character's maximum roll on a single Hit Die (we're keeping this system, I *really* like it, but it should actually matter outside the one og5e short rest you take before you sleep - interrupting long rests are a fine way to go, but its... Bad? To do this or have this done on either side of the table. Especially poorly.) plus their constitution modifier, times their level.

> ``V = (1HD+CON)*LVL``

For example, my party is composed of 4 characters who all have a Con mod of 0; a Barbarian, Jessup, a Ranger, Folyian, a Cleric, Meshueicyn, and a Wizard, Barrug. We are level five, so we each have five hit die; we also know that our maximum vitality is a multiple of five, because we are fifth level and all have a +0 CON.

Jessup, being a Barbarian, has the largest Hit Die in the game, the d12. His maximum Vitality is 60. 

Jessup, again, still being a Barbarian, is often resistant to "weapon" damage types, and therefore *could* be argued to have an effective maximum Vitality of 120. Wow.

Folyian is our Ranger, and Meshueicyn is our Cleric. Both these classes have a Hit Die of a d8. They have a maximum Vitality of 40. Okay, we should try to stay behind our barbarian, they're going to have 3x our Vitality most of the time.

Barrug is our Wizard. Wizards have a Hit Die of a d6. At level five, Barrug has a maximum vitality of 30. 

Great! Now we've gone adventuring a bunch and we all survived and we leveled up a bunch. Now we're level 15!

Jessup has a MV of 180 (or ~360, when raging), Folyian and Meshueicyn have a MV of 120, and Barrug has a MV of 90.

When compared to a og5e party, we look pretty tough (do we?), and don't get it twisted, we are. We'd fuck em up for sure, I think.

Imagine if any of us had a positive CON mod.
Or a **negative** one...

## Mortal Wounds
A character can endure a number of mortal wounds equal to their Constitution modifier. If a character ever endures a number of Mortal Wounds equal to their Constitution Score, they immediately die.

When a character takes "damage" that would push them below 0 vitality, they immediately take a Mortal Wound. 

> If a character reaches exactly 0 Vitality, god-damn that's sick. They will now take one MW per Attack they are hit with, but that's such a fucking moment.

After a character has been exposed to a mortal wound, they may immediately spend a number of Hit Die equal to their Constitution modifier and add the total number (of only the dice rolled, at this point, your Con mod has done its job; Roll High. Or Die.) to their current Vitality.

> If their modifier is 0, or negative, it sure *sucks to suck* don't it? 
> Seems to me, you should have stayed in the fucking *library*, not the battlefield! 
> ***Pwned~!***
> 
> In all seriousness, this isnt meant to be about punishing your players and their characters.
> This hack of the og5e mechanics is meant to be about changing how death, dying, and getting there feels. 

## Death Call
When a character has endured more than as many Mortal Wounds as they can, at the beginning of their turn or when they gain a new Mortal Wound, they make a Death Call. 

Roll a d20. Add nothing, other than your prayers to the Fates and Ar'Kraven. 

If the roll is a ten or higher, you succeed, and you maintain yourself during these next six seconds. Otherwise, you fail to do so, and take one point of Exhaustion.

## Healing & Death
Most mechanics act as og5e; those spells that would heal HP heal Vitality, those spells that cure ailments, even those considered lesser, cure Mortal Wounds, and sometimes Exhaustion (as well as their usual restorative powers, of course).

When a character dies, their soul is immediately disconnected from their body, and this essence of being is transported, albeit slowly, to the plane where it will spend the rest of its existence. 

This essence of being, this soul, can be recovered and restored to a body, either in whole or part by many magics of this realm, including those that would typically perform such an act in og5e, with some caveats.

### The Fading Spirit
###### as inspired/ripped by/from Matthew Mercer and Critical Role
If a character is dead, their spirit is already beginning to erode in the Etherial and Astral planes, and once it has moved into it's Final Plane, it is very difficult to recover.

#### Attempting Ressurection
When attempting a resurrection by any means other than by a *True Ressurrection*, *Wish*, or a one-action-casting-time spell, a **Resurrection Challenge** is initiated. The base DC for this challenge is 10. It is modulated by up to three **Resurrection Challenge Contributions** and the number of times this soul has been brought back from *True Death*. 

When attempting a resurrection by means of a one-action-casting-time spell, a **Rapid Resurrection Challenge** is initiated. The base DC for this challenge is 10. It is modulated by the caster's spellcasting ability modifier and the number of times this soul has been brought back from *True Death*. 

#### Contributions
Any characters who wish to **Contribute** to a **Resurrection Challenge** may do so, in nearly any manner they see fit. Your DM will set the DC and type of the check determining the success of your character's actions; for example, a cleric of Ar'Kraven may beseech their God to allow this mortal to continue their time on this plane, which I would interpret as an easy to medium Charisma (Religion) check, or a godless barbarian may simply demand that their comrade rise if they wish not to be forever haunted by the barbarian after their death, which I would interpret as a hard to neigh-impossible Charisma (Intimidation) check.

#### Finally...
After all contributions are completed, and the DC of the challenge is calculated and presented, the caster rolls the final check of the **Resurrection Challenge** publicly.

If the number rolled on the die is greater than or equal to the DC of the **Resurrection Challenge**, and the character's spirit is willing and able, they return to the Material Plane, as per the specifics of the spell used.

If the **Resurrection Challenge** was **Rapid**, another, more powerful & dedicated **Resurrection Challenge** may be attempted, though it is only a matter of time before thier spirit is lost to the Outer Planes.
