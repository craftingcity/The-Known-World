### Concoct: Elixir
At 1st level, as an Attack, you throw an Elixir. Expend one Reagent Point and roll a d6 on the Elixir Effect Table. Then, choose a point you can see within 30ft of you where the Elixir will land.

| d6  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1   | *Explosion* - Creatures and Objects within a 10ft radius of the point take 2d6+INT force damage.                                                                                                      |

| 5   | *Eruption* - Within a 5ft radius of the point, grey earth fills the radius, creating a 5ft raised surface within the radius.                                                                      |

### Infuse Trinket
At 2nd level, as a Bonus Action, you may expend a number of Reagent Points to infuse a small item or object with your choice of an Infusion from the Infusion Table. The item or object remains Infused until it is used, or you finish a long rest.

| Cost | Effect                                                                                                                                                               |

| 1    | *Offensive* - When you next make an Attack Roll, you expend the Infusion and gain +2 to hit.                                                                         |
| 1    | *Reflexive* - When you next make a Saving Throw, you expend the Infusion and gain +2 to that Save.                                                                   |
| 1    | *Protective* - When you next are the target of an Attack, you expend the Infusion and gain +1 to your AC.                                                            |
| 2    | *Concussive* - When you next take Damage, you expend the Infusion and roll 2d6. You deal an amount of force damage equal to the result to the source of your damage. |
| 2    | *Operative* - When you next make an Initiative Roll, you expend the Infusion and gain +2 to the result.                                                               |
| 3    | *Competitive* - When you next Hit on an Attack, you expend the Infusion and roll twice for the Damage you deal, taking the higher total result.                      |

At 14th level, the effects granted by expending your Infusions are more powerful. *Offensive*, *Reflexive*, and *Operative* Infusions grant +4, *Protective* Infusions grant +2, *Concussive* Infusions roll 4d6, and *Competitive* Infusions read '... and deal the maximum damage for the attack instead of rolling.'

### Mobile Laboratory
At 3rd level, during a long rest, you may modify a mobile space you occupy or own (such as a cart or a room on a ship) with secured alchemical facilities to create your Mobile Laboratory. 

At 3rd level, your Mobile Laboratory grants you the following effects;

- While your Laboratory is accessible, when you finish a short rest, you may regain Reagent Points by spending an Alchemical Component valued at 5sp or more. The number of Reagent Points you regain is equal to one-fifth the value of the Alchemical component spent, rounded down.
- While your Laboratory is accessible, when you finish a long rest, you may assign your Mobile Laboratory an Alchemical Recipe that you know. When you do, you spend the Alchemical Components required for that recipe, and your Laboratory begins performing the processes of that Recipe. When you next finish a long rest while your Laboratory is accessible, you gather one unit of the Alchemical Product of that Recipe, and may re-assign your Laboratory.
	- During the Grading of a product, your Mobile Laboratory will use your number of Alchemist levels as the result of its die roll, and your choice of your Arcana or Survival Skills.
	- You may still use your Laboratory as normal while it is performing an assignment.

At 9th level, your Mobile Laboratory grants you the following additional effects;

- When you would gather an Alchemical Product from your Mobile Laboratory, you gather two units instead of one.
- While your Laboratory is accessible, when you finish a long rest, you may assign your Mobile Laboratory an Alchemical Product that you own. When you do, you destroy the Alchemical Product and your Laboratory begins scribing the Alchemical Recipe used to create that Product. When you next finish a long rest while your Laboratory is accessible, you gather the Alchemical Recipe of that Product, and may re-assign your Laboratory.

At 15th level, your Mobile Laboratory grants you the following additional effects;

- Whenever you spend an Alchemical Component to regain Reagent Points, you gain twice as many Reagent Points.
- While your Laboratory is accessible, when you finish a long rest, you may choose up to three Alchemical Components that you own. You gain another unit of each of those Components.

### Extra Attack
At 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

At 17th level, you can attack thrice, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Concoct: Powderblast
At 6th level, as an Attack, you throw a Powderblast. Spend two Reagent Points and roll a d6 on the Powderblast Effect Table. Then, you choose a point you can see within 20ft where the Powderblast erupts into a 5ft radius sphere. The Powder remains concentrated in this radius for 1 minute (10 rounds), or until a strong wind disperses the Powder. 

| d6  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
