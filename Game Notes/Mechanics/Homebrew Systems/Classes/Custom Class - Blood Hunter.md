## Subclass Lobotomy
#### Profane Soul
##### Soul Contract (*optional*)
You may take this feature at 1st level.

When you gain this feature, you, the real player, have made a deal with the Fates of Alaturmen to become committed to reaching 11th level in the Blood Hunter class at the possible expense of your character's soul. In addition, you gain a feat of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites, but you must take the following three features; **Curse Specialty**, **Blood Frenzy**, and **Fate's Bargain** instead of any other Blood Hunter Order features.

##### Curse Specialty
You take this feature instead of the **Pact Magic** feature at 3rd level.

You learn a *blood curse* of your choice. Learn another at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th levels.

##### Blood Frenzy
You take this feature instead of the **Mystic Frenzy** feature at 7th level.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hitpoints that you have not affected with a *blood curse*, you regain a use of your **Brand of Castigation** feature.

##### Fate's Bargain
You take this feature instead of the **Brand of the Sapping Scar** feature at 11th level.

Your soul is your own again.

## Blood Curses
##### Curse of the Warrior
As a bonus action, choose a creature you have already made an Attack against this turn. Then, make an Attack roll against that creature. You may use this *blood curse* a number of times equal to the maximum value of your *hemocraft die*.

*Amplify*. You may choose any creature instead.
