The Measuring & Weighing Tools are used to guarantee precision during processes.
##### Tongs & Spatulas
The Tongs & Spatulas are used to manipulate ingredients and essences.
##### Mortar and Pestle
The Mortar and Pestle is used to grind by the application of pressure.
##### Retort
The Retort is used to distill liquids via the application of heat.
##### Calciner
The Calciner is used to purify ingredients and essences through 'thermal treatment'.

### Stationary Laboratory Equipment
##### Alembic
The Alembic is a lab-grade distillation configuration; composed of a heating element or chamber, a large retort for your subject material, a tube system pointing into a vessel to contain your result material.
##### Ash Furnace
The Ash Furnace is a lab-grade heating configuration, where a subject is placed inside the vessel to be heated by a tight furnace and the fuels are reduced to ash, and then fall into another vessel below.
##### Growth Chamber
The Growth Chamber is an area of a lab that is exclusively for the act of growing flora ingredients.
##### Calciner Kiln
The Claciner Kiln is a lab-grade calcination configuration, where a subject is placed in a Calciner, which is placed in a kiln.

### Mechanical Laboratory Equipment
##### Grinder
The Grinder is a lab-grade ablation configuration; composed of two grinding wheels atop a powder hopper and a vessel for containing your result material.
##### Mechanical Press
The Mechanical Press is a lab-grade force-application configuration; composed of two moving walls and two solid ones, providing energy to the press pushes the walls together, resulting in a crushed subject.
##### Driven Mixer
The Driven Mixer is a lab-grade combination configuration; composed of a single vessel for the subjects and a rotating whisk upon an arm.
##### Mass Filter
The Mass Filter is a lab-grade filtration configuration; composed of dozens filtration planes of descending size, where each plane sends its subject to their own vessels. 
##### Rotating Centrifuge
The Rotating Centrifuge is a lab-grade separation configuration; composed of a half-dozen specialized vessels stored equidistantly on a rotating plane.
##### Sink Polisher

##### Pyrosymile Crucible
The Pyrosymile Crucible is a magical lab-grade heating equipment, usually a cauldron or crucible.
##### Hyper Pressure Locker
The Hyper Pressure Locker is a magical lab-grade pressurization equipment, usually a simple front-opening box, locker, or safe.
##### Electrolysistem
The Electrolysistem is a magical lab-grade electrolysis equipment, usually a specialized vessel with two conductive rods in the center.
##### Auspex Scope
The Auspex Scope is a magical lab-grade identification equipment, usually a set of two or more auspex lenses in a stable rotating cylinder.

## Common Productions
### Tools
#### Equipment
##### Witch Sticks
> Witch Sticks begin as simple twigs before spending time in a well-mixed solution bath of Arcana and Bane essences. After the twigs have soaked in the solution, they are coated in powdered pewter, and calcified. 

When set aflame, the Witch Sticks produce a smoke with magical-dissociative properties. Witch Sticks are typically bundled into 8 sticks before they are sold as a set.

*Witchweed* is the typical choice for production of Bane Essence. *Polypore* is the typical choice for production of Arcana Essence. A cup of Essence will coat 8 sticks.
