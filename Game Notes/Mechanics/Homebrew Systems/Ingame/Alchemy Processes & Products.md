## Tools & Their Purpose
### Basic Laboratory Equipment
#### Vessels / Tanks
The Vessel (or Tank) is used to store ingredients and essences.
#### Measuring & Weighing Tools
The Measuring & Weighing Tools are used to guarantee precision during processes.
#### Tongs & Spatulas
The Tongs & Spatulas are used to manipulate ingredients and essences.
#### Mortar and Pestle
The Mortar and Pestle is used to grind by the application of pressure.
#### Retort
The Retort is used to distill liquids via the application of heat.
#### Calciner
The Calciner is used to purify ingredients and essences through 'thermal treatment'.

### Stationary Laboratory Equipment
#### Alembic
The Alembic is a lab-grade distillation configuration; composed of a heating element or chamber, a large retort for your subject material, a tube system pointing into a vessel to contain your result material.
#### Ash Furnace
The Ash Furnace is a lab-grade heating configuration, where a subject is placed inside the vessel to be heated by a tight furnace and the fuels are reduced to ash, and then fall into another vessel below.
#### Growth Chamber
The Growth Chamber is an area of a lab that is exclusively for the act of growing flora ingredients.
#### Calciner Kiln
The Claciner Kiln is a lab-grade calcination configuration, where a subject is placed in a Calciner, which is placed in a kiln.

### Mechanical Laboratory Equipment
#### Grinder
The Grinder is a lab-grade ablation configuration; composed of two grinding wheels atop a powder hopper and a vessel for containing your result material.
#### Mechanical Press
#### Driven Mixer
#### Mass Filter
#### Rotating Centrifuge
#### Sink Polisher
