# Combat Mechanics
## Opportunity Attack
When a creature **Moves** away from an opponent, unless they have **Disengaged**, they present their opponent with a chance to strike; an *Opportunity Attack*. By spending their Reaction, the second creature can make one Melee Weapon Attack against the first.

A creature triggers an *Opportunity Attack* when they voluntarily **Move** outside their opponent's 'Engagement Range', the area they can **Reach** with whatever they're holding. 

## High Ground
When a creature makes an **Attack** against an opponent that is below them by 5' or more, that **Attack** is made with **Advantage**.

## Cover
When a creature is **Attacked**, they attempt to take *Cover*, and gain a bonus to their AC and Dexterity Saving Throws based on the kind of *Cover* between them and the Attacker.

**Low Cover**, such as a wooden barrier or pile of stones, grants +2 to AC and Dexterity Saving Throws.

**High Cover**, such as the corner of a wall or large crate, grants +5 AC and Dexterity Saving Throws.

## Prone
When a creature is *Prone*, they are lying on the floor. Standing from *Prone* costs 15' of **Movement**.

While *Prone*, a creature has **Disadvantage** on **Attack Rolls** if they are not making that **Attack** with a *Firearm*. Additionally, they grant **Disadvantage** to ranged attacks against them, but **Advantage** to **Attacks** within 5'.

## Thrown Weapons and Objects
Non-traditional throwing weapons, such as alchemical reagents or explosive grenades, use a standard **Attack** when thrown. After choosing a target, the attacker makes an **Athletics** Skill Check. If the result is 20 or higher, they are completely accurate. If the result is less than 20, they are inaccurate by 1 space at 15 or above, by 2 spaces at 10 or above, or by 3 spaces at 5 or above. If the result is a 1, they drop it in front of themselves.

## Ammunition
Most Ranged Weapons consume Ammunition. If that Ammunition is not *Fragile*, it can be recollected in entirety by spending time and making an **Investigation** Skill Check. If the result is 15 or more, all used Ammunition is recovered. If the result is less than 15, three-quarters is recovered at 10 or above, and half is recovered at 5 or above.

## Consuming Potions
Consuming a potion for yourself costs a **Bonus Action**. Forcing someone else to drink a potion is a **Standard Action**.

## Flanking
When two creatures surround an opponent, if they are not adjacent, the allies are *Flanking* their opponent, who is considered *Flanked*.

A creature who is *Flanked* cannot be *Flanking* with their allies, and grants attacks against it have **Advantage**.
