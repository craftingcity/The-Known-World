# Combat Mechanics
## Opportunity Attack
When a creature **Moves** away from an opponent, unless they have **Disengaged**, they present their opponent with a chance to strike; an *Opportunity Attack*. By spending their Reaction, the second creature can make one Melee Weapon Attack against the first.

A creature triggers an *Opportunity Attack* when they voluntarily **Move** outside their opponent's 'Engagement Range', the area they can **Reach** with whatever they're holding. 

## Flanking
When two creatures surround an opponent, if they are not adjacent, the allies are *Flanking* their opponent, who is considered *Flanked*.

A creature who is *Flanked* cannot be *Flanking* with their allies, and grants attacks against it have **Advantage**.

## High Ground
When a creature makes an **Attack** against an opponent that is below them by 3' or more, that **Attack** is made with **Advantage**.

## Cover
When a creature is **Attacked**, they attempt to take **Cover**, and gain a bonus to their AC and Dexterity Saving Throws based on the kind of **Cover** between them and the Attacker.

**Low Cover**, such as 

## Crouched
## Prone
