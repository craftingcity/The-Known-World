# Positioning
## Opportunity Attack
When a creature **Moves** away from an opponent, unless they have **Disengaged**, they present their opponent with a chance to strike; an *Opportunity Attack*. By spending their Reaction, the second creature can make one Melee Weapon Attack against the first.

A creature triggers an *Opportunity Attack* when they voluntarily **Move** outside their opponent's 'Engagement Range', the area they can *reach* with whatever they're holding. 

## High Ground
When a creature makes an **Attack** against an opponent that is below them by 5' or more, that **Attack** is made with **Advantage**.

## Cover
When a creature is **Attacked**, they attempt to take *Cover*, and gain a bonus to their AC and Dexterity Saving Throws based on the kind of *Cover* between them and the Attacker.

**Low Cover**, such as a wooden barrier or pile of stones, grants +2 to AC and Dexterity Saving Throws.

**High Cover**, such as the corner of a wall or large crate, grants +5 AC and Dexterity Saving Throws.

## Prone
When a creature is *Prone*, they are lying on the floor. Standing from *Prone* costs 15' of **Movement**.

While *Prone*, a creature has **Disadvantage** on **Attack Rolls** if they are not making that **Attack** with a *Firearm*. Additionally, they grant **Disadvantage** to ranged attacks against them, but **Advantage** to **Attacks** within 5'.

## Flanking
When two creatures surround an opponent, if they are not adjacent, the allies are *Flanking* their opponent, who is considered *Flanked*.

A creature who is *Flanked* cannot be *Flanking* with their allies, and attacks against it have **Advantage**.

##### Examples
In the following examples, 'A' and 'B' are allies, fighting 'P', 'Q', and 'R'. 'B' can occupy any of it's labeled spaces in the following examples.

EXAMPLE 1: Valid
| x  | A  | x  |
| x  | P  | x  |
| B  | B  | B  | 

EXAMPLE 2: Valid
| x  | A  | x  |

| B  | B  | B  | 

EXAMPLE 3: Not Valid
| x  | A  | x  |

| x  | x  | x  | 

EXAMPLE 4: Not Valid
| Q  | A  | R  |
| x  | P  | x  |
| B  | B  | B  | 

# Combat Mechanics
## Ammunition
Most Ranged Weapons consume Ammunition. If that Ammunition is not *fragile*, it can be recollected in entirety by spending time and making an **Investigation** Skill Check. If the result is 15 or more, all used Ammunition is recovered. If the result is less than 15, three-quarters is recovered at 10 or above, and half is recovered at 5 or above.

## Grenade
This weapon is a grenade, designed to be readied, thrown, and then explode. When you make an Attack with a grenade, instead of making an Attack Roll, make an Athletics Check. You may throw the grenade a number of feet equal to twice the total of your Athletics Check. To avoid the explosion, creatures within the radius make a Dexterity Saving throw, the DC of which is equal to your Athletics Check.

## Consuming Potions
Consuming a potion for yourself costs a **Bonus Action**. Forcing someone else to drink a potion is a **Standard Action**.

## Changing Weapons or Held Items During Combat
Dropping something in your hands is a **Free Action**. The item or items land at your feet.
Putting something away is an **Object Interaction**. The item is stowed.
Pulling something out is an **Object Interaction**. The item is wielded.
You may perform a second **Object Interaction** on your turn by using your **Bonus Action**.

## Oversized Weapons
Larger creatures can wield larger weapons more easily. For creatures of a size-class of 'Large' or greater, Melee Weapons with the *two-handed* property but without the *very heavy* property become *versatile (d+)* instead of *two-handed* for them.

## Reach & Reach Weapons


## Equipment Slots
To gain the benefits of a given item, you must assign it to a valid slot. You may only gain the benefits of a single item in a given slot. Some items may occupy more than one slot, in which case, you must assign it to all slots to gain its benefits.

The item slots are as follows (total of 13 non-armor):
	- Head (4)
		- *Armor*
		- Top of Head
		- Eyewear / Face Cover

	- Torso (6)

# The Fading Spirit
###### as inspired/ripped by/from Matthew Mercer and Critical Role
If a character is dead, their spirit is beginning to separate from their material vessel, and begin drifting to their Final Plane. Once a spirit has moved into it's Final Plane, it becomes very difficult to recover.

## Attempting Resurrections
When attempting a resurrection by any means other than by a *True Ressurrection* or *Wish*, a **Resurrection Challenge** is initiated. The base DC for this challenge is 10. It is reduced by up to three **Resurrection Challenge Contributions** and increased by the number of times this soul has been brought back from *True Death*. 

### Contributions
Any characters who wish to **Contribute** to a **Resurrection Challenge** may do so, in nearly any manner they see fit. 

Your DM will set the DC and type of the check determining the success of your character's actions; for example, a cleric of Ar'Kraven may beseech their God to allow this mortal to continue their time on this plane, which could be interpreted as an easy to medium Charisma (Religion) check, or a godless barbarian may simply demand that their comrade rise if they wish not to be forever hunted by the barbarian after their death, which could be interpreted as a hard to neigh-impossible Charisma (Intimidation) check.

## Finally...
After all contributions are completed, and the DC of the challenge is calculated and presented, the caster rolls the final check of the **Resurrection Challenge** publicly.

If the number rolled on the die is greater than or equal to the DC of the **Resurrection Challenge**, and the character's spirit is willing and able, they return to the Material Plane, as per the specifics of the spell used. Otherwise, the character experiences a *True Death*.
