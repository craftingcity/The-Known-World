# Alchemy!
## Introducing Alchemy
Alchemy is the act of harnessing the latent magical energy in all things known as "Weave Potentia". When this energy is harnessed, it will affect the world around it, or sometimes produce an effect known as "Weave Arcane", an invoked and (ideally) purposed manifestation of this energy. This involves some chemical processes, some magical processes, and a very cryptic and loose set of laws; [[The Axioms, Theories, and Philosophies of Mages of the First Century]].

The key to successful alchemy is understanding and controlling this Weave-Potentia. This energy is present in all things, and can be harnessed to produce a variety of effects. It is important to note that the Weave is not a fixed or static thing - it can be influenced and controlled, but it has yet to be fully understood. This makes alchemy a difficult, but potentially very rewarding, art. It is also important to remember that alchemy is not without risk. The results of alchemy can be unpredictable, and sometimes dangerous.

### Grades
The grades of alchemist, as presented lowest to highest, are Apprentice, Novice, Journeyman, Expert, and Master. Each grade is determined by the level of experience and expertise an individual has.

As an apprentice alchemist, you will support the work of your mentor, a journeyman, expert, or master themselves, in creating the standard products of their establishments.

As a novice alchemist, you are expected to have made a name for yourself among the community, and be an asset to any alchemical endeavor you undertake. A novice alchemist is capable of creating complicated products.

As a journeyman alchemist, you are expected to be a full-time alchemist. You may be able to support yourself fully on the income of your craft. You can create the full range of standard products, and are capable of many more experimental products. You may be required to work with and teach an apprentice.

An expert alchemist is a full-time alchemist, capable of handling any task given to them. They have created their own original formulas, and have introduced many improvements upon the basic arts.

A master alchemist is a ***full***-time alchemist, capable of handling *any* task given to them, and is capable of creating *any* effect desired. A master alchemist is free to pursue any endeavor they wish, and is highly sought after for their skills. A master alchemist is an individual of great talent and power, respected by all who know them.

### How do *I* start doing Alchemy?
#### Alchemical Motifs

In an effort to systemize the practice of Alchemy for themselves and the future of the art, research was concurrently performed by [[Doctor Gunagido]] of [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]] and [[Alergra Barrowinch]] of [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] in their respective laboratories, and both researchers would come to submit functionally identical findings in this regard. These two documents expand on the work previously written by [[Scree'up]] and [[Dimble Turing]] of [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], the aforementioned '[[The Axioms, Theories, and Philosophies of Mages of the First Century]]', by providing a framework on which the modern understanding of Alchemy rests - the *Twenty-Eight Barrowinch-Gunagido Alchemical Motifs*.

Represented as a series of concentric shapes or rings, the Barrowinch-Gunagido Alchemical Motifs categorizes the Weave Potentia of any given component (or product) by its 'Major Motif', the motif it is most relevant or aligned with, and then its 'Minor Motifs', the other relevant or aligned Potentia in a given component. The Motifs, and their place in the concentric rings, are as follows;

- **Core Ring**, the basest elements
	- Earth
	- Air
	- Water
	- Fire
- **Inner Ring**, the effects of those elements 
	- Healing
	- Disease
	- Illusion
	- Light
	- Arcana
	- Weight
	- Form
	- Poison
- **Outer Ring**, the effects of those effects
	- Desist
	- Divine
	- Regenerate
	- Necrot
	- Degenerate
	- Fabrim
	- Charm
	- Evoke
	- Immute
	- Dunam
	- Immort
	- Dragon
	- Mortal
	- Abjure
	- Bane
	- Spirit

#### Basic Kit
There are four tools that are considered integral in the Alchemist's kit. The first is the Mortar and Pestle, used for mixing and grinding ingredients into powders or pastes. Second, the Calcinator, a heat-proof container used for indirect heat processes. Third and Fourth are the Alembic and Retort, which are used for wet and dry distillation respectively.

These tools can be made small and portable enough that they can be brought along as equipment during adventures or mobile laboratories. If this process is done poorly, it could damage the equipment's ability to produce high-grade products.

A permanent lab can grow and shrink to the needs of an alchemist, but anything more than a Basic Kit will require a permanent housing.

### Mechanics
#### Production
The act of creating an alchemical product by a player is both an in-game performance that include collecting ingredients, equipment, knowledge, and creativity, as well as a roll of Intelligence (Arcana / Alchemist's Tools) for mechanical effect. 

When this check is performed during downtime, or by an NPC, one would "take ten", and calculate as though they had rolled a ten on the die.
