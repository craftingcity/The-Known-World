# Walking the Planes
## Alaturmen
Alaturmen's creation is unique, among the surrounding Planes, and so too are its abilities. Submerged in the Ethereal and Astral planes, Alaturmen holds a bubble of transition, known as the Wildlands, that protects the mortals inhabiting this Plane from the nature of the surrounding Planes.

## Plane-walking
Those entities that wish to, or simply do, enter the Wildlands, a harrowing task stands before them; **Plane-Walking**.

When one begins **Plane-Walking**, if they have a destination in mind, they must speak it aloud into the Immaterial Planes. 

> During the entirety of the **Plane-Walking**, one must maintain Concentration on this destination. Should they fail this Concentration Check, they will become *destination-less*.
> One will make this check at the beginning of any Rest period. 

As you are **Planes-Walking**, for as long as you maintain concentration on your destination, that destination's Progress DC is halved for you and you may select a new destination by speaking it aloud into the Wildlands. 

To make a Concentration or Progress check during **Planes-Walking**, roll 1d20. Then, add your WIS, and, if you are Proficient in Endurance, add your Proficiency Bonus. 

For every Progress DC you beat, you gain one Progress toward a "plane-sheet" (an unstable gate that forms throughout the Wildlands) of that color & destination. A character need not enter a plane-sheet they encounter, and are under no arcane or ethereal desire to do so. After encountering a plane-sheet of one kind, it's Progress resets and continues as normal.

If you are or become *destination-less*, you cannot attempt to choose another destination - that is left now to the Fates. In addition, you make all Progress Checks with Disadvantage.

For every Concentration & (or) Progress check you make (our mechanical representation of one unit of time observed by our party) beyond your character's Wisdom Score, you make the checks with Disadvantage.
