# Roll Hie. Or Die.
It is my intention to hack the current 5e system of HP, Hit Die, AC, and Death Saves as a complete representation of a character's "health" into something akin to VtM's "superficial wounds" & "mortal wounds" or Darkes Dungeon's Death's Door, that also maybe lets me play with higher damages for my "normal" weapons.

## Vitality
A character's ability to "tank", dodge, parry, block, evade, or otherwise not become truly Wounded is known as their Vitality. 

This is equal to the maximum value of a character's hit die plus their Constitution modifier times their level. 

> In familiar terms, the only difference in calculating Vitality and Hit Points is one does not ever roll to determine a character's Maximum Vitality.
> 
> ``V = (1HD+CON)*LVL``

## Wounds
A character can endure a number of Wounds equal to their Constitution modifier. 

If a character ever endures a number of Wounds equal to their Constitution Score, they immediately die.

If a character is forced to expend more Vitality than they currently have, they immediately take a Wound instead. 

After a character has been exposed to a Wound, they may immediately spend a number of Hit Die equal to their Constitution modifier and add the total number to their current Vitality.

## Death Call
When a character has endured more than as many Wounds as they can, at the beginning of their turn or whenever they gain a new Wound, they make a Death Call. 

To make a Death Call, roll a d20. Add nothing to it, other than your prayers to the Fates and Ar'Kraven. 

If the roll is a ten or higher, you succeed, and you maintain yourself during these next six seconds. Otherwise, you fail to do so, and take one point of Exhaustion.

## Healing & Death
Most mechanics act as og5e; those spells that would heal HP heal Vitality, those spells that cure ailments, even those considered lesser, cure Wounds, and sometimes Exhaustion (as well as their usual restorative powers, of course).

When a character dies, their soul is immediately disconnected from their body, and this essence of being is transported, albeit slowly, to the plane where it will spend the rest of its existence. 

This essence of being, this soul, can be recovered and restored to a body, either in whole or part by many magics of this realm, including those that would typically perform such an act in og5e, with some caveats.

### The Fading Spirit
###### as inspired/ripped by/from Matthew Mercer and Critical Role
If a character is dead, their spirit is already beginning to erode in the Etherial and Astral planes, and once it has moved into it's Final Plane, it is very difficult to recover.

#### Attempting Ressurection
When attempting a resurrection by any means other than by a *True Ressurrection*, *Wish*, or a one-action-casting-time spell, a **Resurrection Challenge** is initiated. The base DC for this challenge is 10. It is modulated by up to three **Resurrection Challenge Contributions** and the number of times this soul has been brought back from *True Death*. 

When attempting a resurrection by means of a one-action-casting-time spell, a **Rapid Resurrection Challenge** is initiated. The base DC for this challenge is 10. It is modulated by the caster's spellcasting ability modifier and the number of times this soul has been brought back from *True Death*. 

#### Contributions
Any characters who wish to **Contribute** to a **Resurrection Challenge** may do so, in nearly any manner they see fit. Your DM will set the DC and type of the check determining the success of your character's actions; for example, a cleric of Ar'Kraven may beseech their God to allow this mortal to continue their time on this plane, which I would interpret as an easy to medium Charisma (Religion) check, or a godless barbarian may simply demand that their comrade rise if they wish not to be forever haunted by the barbarian after their death, which I would interpret as a hard to neigh-impossible Charisma (Intimidation) check.

#### Finally...
After all contributions are completed, and the DC of the challenge is calculated and presented, the caster rolls the final check of the **Resurrection Challenge** publicly.

If the number rolled on the die is greater than or equal to the DC of the **Resurrection Challenge**, and the character's spirit is willing and able, they return to the Material Plane, as per the specifics of the spell used.

If the **Resurrection Challenge** was **Rapid**, another, more powerful & dedicated **Resurrection Challenge** may be attempted, though it is only a matter of time before their spirit is lost to the Outer Planes.
