# Walking the Planes
## Alaturmen
Alaturmen's creation is unique, among the surrounding Planes, and so too are its abilities. Submerged in the Ethereal and Astral planes, Alaturmen holds a bubble of transition, known as the Wildlands, that protects the mortals inhabiting this Plane from the nature of the surrounding Planes.

## Plane-walking
Those entities that wish to, or simply do, enter the Wildlands, a harrowing task stands before them; **Plane-Walking**.

When one begins **Plane-Walking**, if they have a destination in mind, they must speak it aloud into the Immaterial Planes. 

> During the entirety of the **Plane-Walking**, one must maintain Concentration on this destination. Should they fail this Concentration Check, they will become *destination-less*; **Plane-Walking** *destination-less* is dangerous, as one may never reach any destination other than their Final Death.
> One will make this check at the beginning of any Rest period. 

To make a concentration check, roll 1d20. Then, add your WIS, and, if you are Proficient in Endurance, add your Proficiency Bonus.
