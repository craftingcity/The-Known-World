Some languages are related by linguistic relatives, and can be understood - to a degree - by someone who knows one of these related languages.

To understand or read a language you do not know, but is related to a language you do know, make an Intelligence Check.

If you reach a 10, you gain a basic understanding of the interaction.

If you reach 15 or higher, you understand the interaction as if you knew the language.
