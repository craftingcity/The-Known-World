You had little contact with the outside world during your time with the Druids, instead they would teach you their values and techniques in mysticism, survivalism, and secrecy.

- [[Guild of Adventurers]]
	- The Guild of Adventurers is a barely-functionally organized enforcement organization that specializes in disrupting major international or interplanar threats *and* the lives of everyday people through the use of wanton destruction, chaos, and greed.
 - Members of the Guild of Adventures are most often employed as mercenaries, guarding caravans or people as they moved around the world. 
- [[Guild of Merchants]]
	- The Guild of Merchants is a major infrastructure and logistics syndicate. Through price manipulation and inter-organization communication, things are made and moved to where they need to be.
 - Members of the Guild of Merchants are most commonly employed as accountants or drivers dealing with consistent, small-load deliveries between major cities or from a major city to its dependants.
	- The [[Guild of Merchants#Thieves Guild|Thieves Guild]] is a silent subdivision of the [[Guild of Merchants]] that specializes in the less-than-publicly-acceptable efforts of monopolizing peace, such as burglary, murder, espionage, and threat enforcement or denial.
- [[Ranger's Guild]]
	- The Ranger's Guild is a tight-knit network of people defending people. The main responsibility for any Ranger is the border of the Wildlands, preventing people from wandering too far and threats from wandering too close.
 - Most members of the Guild of Rangers are employed as small-town wardens, dealing with local pests or provisional issues - your most important duty, however, is warning the ignorant of the danger presented by the Wildlands.
- [[Guild of Crafters]]
	- The Guild of Crafters are responsible for the Coalition's major constructions and their bank of skill-craft information. Many of the Plane's most common technologies are kept well secret by these specialized Craftsfolk.
 - Most members of the Guild of Crafters are genuine artisans, having specialized in a given craft or trade and excelled enough in that field to be hired into the Guilds.
- [[Guild of Wizards]]
	- The Guild of Wizards maintains the largest collections of public knowledge avaliable to the world, and acts as the collective body responsible for the major decisions made by the Guilds at large. In addition to this, the Guild of Wizards works to investigate, list, or eliminate any and all spellcasters, magical items, or anomalies and the knowledge, materials, and effects surrounding them.
 - Members of the Guild of Wizards are most commonly employed as accountants or researchers, dealing with magical items or processes and the overwhelming bureaucratic process of recording any and all information regarding the past, present, and future of the subject.
