## Druidic Circle

You spent your life before adventure with one of the many Druidic Circles of Alaturmen. You had little contact with the outside world during your time with the Druids, instead they would teach you their values and techniques in mysticism, survivalism, and secrecy. The location of your home must remain unknown, otherwise risking the life, limb, and unfound secrets of your home - you must be from nowhere and everywhere.

You gain +2 to your *Wisdom Score* and +1 to your *Constitution Score*. You are proficient in the *Nature* and *Survival* skills. You know [[Druidic (language)]] and your choice of one of the following pairs;
- [[Fanyaquestan (language)]] and [[Primordial (language)#Terrin]]
	>The [[Druids of Terran]] are hidden somewhere within [[The Holyl'nds]], and are embroiled in the local conflicts between [[The Church of the White Flame]] and the smaller communities they attempt to supplant. The [[Druids of Terran]] somehow lost their Idol, *Terra*, circa 040AF, and have since made relocating it their top priority.
- [[Desertspeech (language)]] and [[Primordial (language)#Ignin]]
	> The [[Druids of Ignan]] are hidden somewhere within [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]], and are dispersed through positions of power within the local factions. Some folks claim that the [[Druids of Ignan]] are wholly responsible for maintaining the stalemate between the three Noble Thieves groups.
- [[Arthurian (language)]] and [[Primordial (language)#Aurin]]
	> The [[Druids of Ventan]] are hidden somewhere within [[The Kingdom of Prosper]], and act in favor of the massive farming population of the Kingdom by affecting the local weather patterns - holding frost at bay or elongating a spring's bounty.
- [[Golopak (language)]] and [[Primordial (language)#Aquin]]
	> The [[Druids of Aquan]] are hidden somewhere within [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], and traditionally ignore the political ongoings of their homeland, instead leading seminars on culture and communal unity where they preach the power of peacetime.

In addition, when you take fire, cold, or lightning damage you may spend and roll one of your hit die and gain the result as temporary hit points.

## Guildmember

You spent your life before adventure with the [[Guilds of Coalition]], likely living in one of the Wards of [[Coalition City]]. Your days were full of bureaucracy, transportation, and political conflict. In honest truth, the city life can be boring. To keep yourself safe, you learned when to keep certain information to yourself, and how to tell who you really can trust. You've seen most people of this world, eaten most of the foods, and been almost nowhere. Time to change that.

You gain +2 to your *Wisdom Score* and +1 to your *Intelligence Score*. You are proficient in the *Deception* and *Insight* skills. You know your choice of two of the following;
- [[Desertspeech (language)]]
- [[Fanyaquestan (language)]]
- [[Arthurian (language)]]
- [[Golopak (language)]]

In addition, you have some form of legal identification of your membership to your Guild. Your earned ability to call upon the full weight of the [[Guilds of Coalition]] could - if used properly - grant you nearly any request you would speak. Choose one of the following;
- [[Guild of Adventurers]]
	> The Guild of Adventurers is a barely-functionally organized enforcement organization that specializes in disrupting major international or interplanar threats *and* the lives of everyday people through the use of wanton destruction, chaos, and greed.
	> Members of the Guild of Adventures are most often employed as mercenaries, guarding caravans or people as they moved around the world. 
- [[Guild of Merchants]]
	> The Guild of Merchants is a major infrastructure and logistics syndicate. Through price manipulation and inter-organization communication, things are made and moved to where they need to be.
	> Members of the Guild of Merchants are most commonly employed as accountants or drivers dealing with consistent, small-load deliveries between major cities or from a major city to its dependants.
	> The [[Guild of Merchants#Thieves Guild|Thieves Guild]] is a silent subdivision of the [[Guild of Merchants]] that specializes in the less-than-publicly-acceptable efforts of monopolizing peace, such as burglary, murder, espionage, and threat enforcement or denial.
- [[Ranger's Guild]]
	> The Ranger's Guild is a tight-knit network of people defending people. The main responsibility for any Ranger is the border of the Wildlands, preventing people from wandering too far and threats from wandering too close.
	> Most members of the Guild of Rangers are employed as small-town wardens, dealing with local pests or provisional issues - your most important duty, however, is warning the ignorant of the danger presented by the Wildlands.
- [[Guild of Crafters]]
	> The Guild of Crafters are responsible for the Coalition's major constructions and their bank of skill-craft information. Many of the Plane's most common technologies are kept well secret by these specialized Craftsfolk.
	> Most members of the Guild of Crafters are genuine artisans, having specialized in a given craft or trade and excelled enough in that field to be hired into the Guilds.
- [[Guild of Wizards]]
	> The Guild of Wizards maintains the largest collections of public knowledge avaliable to the world, and acts as the collective body responsible for the major decisions made by the Guilds at large. In addition to this, the Guild of Wizards works to investigate, list, or eliminate any and all spellcasters, magical items, or anomalies and the knowledge, materials, and effects surrounding them.
	> Members of the Guild of Wizards are most commonly employed as accountants or researchers, dealing with magical items or processes and the overwhelming bureaucratic process of recording any and all information regarding the past, present, and future of the subject.

## Kingdom of Prosper
You spent your life before adventure in [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]. You have personally met with the [[Arthur Simonson|The Great Adventurer King]]. You spoke with him about history, honesty, and the moral right to a happy, educated, and full life. Most of the population of Prosper work the hundreds of fields of rye, squash, and beans that feed their neighbors and large military reserve - the guardsfolk, the Knights, and the engineers that keep Prosper on the cutting edge of military might - very useful, now that war has come to the north.

## Blood Clans
You spent your life before adventure with one of the [[Blood Clans]] of the [[Illburn Forest]]. You knew that if you were not found useful, you would be found dead. You have been spilling blood, sweat, and tears since long before your adventure began.

The Blood Clans were born in response to the growing power of the [[Bandit Lords]], creating an opposed federation. Since the fall of the Bandit Lords circa 060AF, however, the Blood Clans have largely dissolved the collectivism of their federation, and returned to infighting.

> The [[Hurraquk Clan]] and the [[Garqwak Clan]] are two opposed halves of one family, and are fighting a bloody war for the other's portion of their mother's territory.
> The [[Emorin Clan]] is a capitalist bureaucracy attempting to distance themselves from their 'warmongering cousins' of the other Clans by participating in the commerce of the larger world.
> The [[Scrivin Clan]] is an anarchistic arcanacracy who use their accursed magics to attack and annex anyone and everything. Well, they try.

## Actstow / Cenva Minyo
You spent your life before adventure in the [[Actstow Hills]]. You may have lived in a home within the suspended forest village, or in the tunnels of the hills themselves. The [[Dwarven Kingdom Actstow]] - a growing industrial powerhouse - would take in a large population of refugees as the [[Great Fires]] began and continued. These refugees, largely of Winter Elven heritage, who would eventually go on to form [[Cenva Minyo]], a state whose sole purpose is the abolition of [[Its Greatness|The Great White Flame]] and it's [[The Church of the White Flame|White Church]]. The [[Dwarven Kingdom Actstow]] and [[Cenva Minyo]] have grown into a mutually beneficial co-habitual relationship that has led the rest of the world to regard them both as one paired half of the other. Together, they support [[The Kingdom of Prosper]] in their efforts against the [[Blood Clans]] and the [[The Church of the White Flame|White Church]].

You gain +2 to your *Charisma Score* and +1 to your *Dexterity Score*. You are proficient with the *Perception* and *Persuasion* Skills. You know [[Actcenvan (language)]] and your choice of one of the following;

# North Western
## Church of the White Flame
You have spent your life before adventure with [[The Church of the White Flame]]. You were watched by the Flame. Guided by it. [[Its Greatness]] is as real as any other God of Alaturmen. You served Its wishes, and the wishes of Its champions, and in return, you were granted a decent life. Since the turn of the century, your society has significantly recovered from the [[Great Fires]] and begun to stretch it's reach eastward - war has come to the north.

> [[Kohnstamm]] is the western-most city in [[The Holyl'nds]], and the largest industrial center of [[The Church of the White Flame]]. As a product of their positive economic circumstance, the few people who leave [[The Holyl'nds]] are typically from here.
> [[Odaya]] is the northern-most city in [[The Holyl'nds]], and the most brutal. As a result of [[The Assault of the Giant Dissenters]] and the loss of [[Baskin]], [[Odaya]] has gathered a significant influx of refugees - and at the same time, the city experiences consistent banditry at the hands of the [[#Waster Nomad]]s to their north-west.
> [[Yagil]] is the eastern-most city in [[The Holyl'nds]], and acts as the major center of supply in the ongoing conflicts with [[Cenva Minyo]] and the [[Dwarven Kingdom Actstow]].
> [[The Holy City of Kanielkiln]] is the capital city of [[The Church of the White Flame]]. Those who are born here are the few capable of becoming Firstchurch, a high honor in [[The Holyl'nds]]. Kanielkin is the center of the [[The Church of the White Flame|Church of Flame]]'s empire, wherein the White Church itself hosts the Blackened Brazier and [[Its Greatness|The Great White Flame]] itself.
> [[Wychway]] is the southern-most city in [[The Holyl'nds]], and is most notable for their social tolerance and their unusual leadership - [[Jorrin Bearscarred]] rules the city as the one leader within the [[The Church of the White Flame|White Church]] that is not Firstchurch or greater, and supports the desegregation & disillusion of the Church's strict caste system.

## Waster Nomad
You have spent your life before adventure without [[The Church of the White Flame]]. Servants of the [[Its Greatness|White Flame]] hunt you when you make your way too close to 'civilization'. If you were lucky, you joined a band of like minds, and lived in squalor and the safety of numbers. Your work was simple, but hard. You would perform manual labor, you would rigorously gather food and materials for your tribe, and above all else, you would fight against the 'Homeland Force' and the 'Holy Crusaders' who would come to do you harm.

> The city of [[Giant's Toe]] is host to [[Macht's Brood]], who occupy the opulent home of their now dead enslavers from the Plane of Earth. As the Brood grew, a portion of the group would travel south, into the west [[Litteortosta]] to form another Brood, the [[Katz Brood]].

# South Western

You have spent your life before adventure in the cool and relatively safe underground tunnels of [[The Golden City]]. You likely have seen conflict occur in the *Inner Ring* only for mere moments before [[Golden Claws]] descended upon the scene and removed the perpetrator permanently.

You have spent your life before adventure roaming [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]], hunting and raiding to survive.

You are a member of your Clan alone - those who are not among you are against you, every encounter is a matter of life and death.

Above all else, [[The Code of Thieves]] teaches respect for life - both yours and your opponents. We fight for our families, all of us. The pain of a loss is sharper than any blade. Think of their mother. Their partner. Their children. Think of yours. I will, when I have my barrel to your chest, and I know you will show me the same respect.

> [[Agrandica's Thieves]] occupy [[Agrandica's Savanna]], an area west of [[Kickoff]] and north of [[Lord's Folly]]. [[Agrandica's Thieves]] have an established trade relationship with the [[Dwarven Kingdom Suremantle]] that leaves the Thieves with a majority share of the metallics trade in the Deserts.
