## Laboratory Equipment
### Basic Laboratory Equipment
##### Vessels / Tanks
The Vessel (or Tank) is used to store ingredients and essences.
##### Measuring & Weighing Tools
The Measuring & Weighing Tools are used to guarantee precision during processes.
##### Tongs & Spatulas
The Tongs & Spatulas are used to manipulate ingredients and essences.
##### Mortar and Pestle
The Mortar and Pestle is used to grind by the application of pressure.
##### Retort
The Retort is used to distill liquids via the application of heat.
##### Calciner
The Calciner is used to purify ingredients and essences through 'thermal treatment'.

### Stationary Laboratory Equipment
##### Alembic
The Alembic is a lab-grade distillation configuration; composed of a heating element or chamber, a large retort for your subject material, a tube system pointing into a vessel to contain your result material.
##### Ash Furnace
The Ash Furnace is a lab-grade heating configuration, where a subject is placed inside the vessel to be heated by a tight furnace and the fuels are reduced to ash, and then fall into another vessel below.
##### Growth Chamber
The Growth Chamber is an area of a lab that is exclusively for the act of growing flora ingredients.
##### Calciner Kiln
The Claciner Kiln is a lab-grade calcination configuration, where a subject is placed in a Calciner, which is placed in a kiln.

### Mechanical Laboratory Equipment
##### Grinder
The Grinder is a lab-grade ablation configuration; composed of two grinding wheels atop a powder hopper and a vessel for containing your result material.
##### Mechanical Press
The Mechanical Press is a lab-grade force-application configuration; composed of two moving walls and two solid ones, providing energy to the press pushes the walls together, resulting in a crushed subject.
##### Driven Mixer
The Driven Mixer is a lab-grade combination configuration; composed of a single vessel for the subjects and a rotating whisk upon an arm.
##### Mass Filter
The Mass Filter is a lab-grade filtration configuration; composed of dozens filtration planes of descending size, where each plane sends its subject to their own vessels. 
##### Rotating Centrifuge
The Rotating Centrifuge is a lab-grade separation configuration; composed of a half-dozen specialized vessels stored equidistantly on a rotating plane.
##### Sink Polisher
The Sink Polisher is a lab-grade polishing configuration; composed of a pair of soft, shifting cloths that polish the subject placed between.

### Alchemical/Magical Laboratory Equipment
##### Chilled Safe
The Chilled Safe is a magical lab-grade freezing or cooling equipment, usually a simple front-opening box, locker, or safe that is constructed with [[#Coolead]], or has been fitted with [[#Kelvin's Wick]].
##### Pyrosymile Crucible
The Pyrosymile Crucible is a magical lab-grade heating equipment, usually a cauldron or crucible that has been patched with precise and powerful heating runes.
##### Hyper Pressure Locker
The Hyper Pressure Locker is a magical lab-grade pressurization equipment, usually a simple front-opening box, locker, or safe that has been fitted with a configured [[#Atmos Sphere]] or [[#Asphyx Sphere]].
##### Electrolysistem
The Electrolysistem is a magical lab-grade electrolysis equipment, usually a specialized vessel with two conductive rods in the center, and an electric generation source, such as a [[#Bottled Thunderstorm]] or a [[#Turbine Engine]].
##### Auspex Scope
The Auspex Scope is a magical lab-grade identification equipment, usually a set of two or more [[#Auspex Lens]] in a stable rotating cylinder.
