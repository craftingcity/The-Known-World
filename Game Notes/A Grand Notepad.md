# CURRENT NOTES
### Historical Markings
I want to make the lore of my world cool and interactive. [[Historical Markings]] on weapons, armor, and other items of importance or value such as coins or paintings are a great idea. #npc characters should make passing remarks about #loreful happenings and characters. Firsthand #text accounts are useful to flesh out these ideas, but cannot be the only way the lore is delivered. Ideally, the story we tell at the table aligns with the story I tell you about this world, and the characters and groups our players interact with should interact with the lore as well. Given that this is a living document, and one that is quite young, we are only at the beginning stages of that idea.

### PROJECT ELVES

Make elves cool and old-tolkein-esq; good crafters and enchanters - similar with dwarves; next to do - but they got hit hard early with [[The Old|Minyostalma]] and the [[50 Year White Burning]].

### Gen
What if [[Kakurak]] died and turned into a lich's pet?

Blood of [[Travis]]; "Blood of a brother..."

[[The Pantheon#Sama]] takes Amashod if she goes down in a fight around here.


# NEXT SESSION

Gudeliva is sick, they need to rest in Ootool. Krenzo pops off the plan before they all enter the city (if it goes off without a hitch, he can use the urban center as getaway). Run Kayus after
