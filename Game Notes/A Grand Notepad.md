# CURRENT NOTES

I want to make the lore of my world cool and interactive. [[Historical Markings]] on weapons, armor, and other items of importance or value such as coins or paintings are a great idea. #npc characters should make passing remarks about #loreful happenings and characters. Firsthand #text accounts are useful to flesh out these ideas, but cannot be the only way the lore is delivered. Ideally, the story we tell at the table aligns with the story I tell you about this world, and the characters and groups our players interact with should interact with the lore as well. Given that this is a living document, and one that is quite young, we are only at the beginning stages of that idea.

What if [[Kakurak]] died and turned into a lich's pet?

Blood of [[Travis]]; "Blood of a brother..."

[[The Pantheon#Sama]] takes Amashod if she goes down in a fight around here.

# NEXT SESSION

Hey Hey! Travel is going well. We moved them toward a duergar city, which means we need to build a duergar city.

Should be easy enough. I'll use paint.

## Three Clue
I want the players to understand some things about [[Heilich-Muwwoq]]

1. This used to be a human mining settlement
	1. the machinery is not of duergar construction
	2. the manors are not of duergar construction
	3. a large population of slaves are human here
2. Bardaux isnt here;
		1. Ungaethram is the largest Drow settlement around
		2. The Da'Furik Family sells slaves, ties to [[Yuurmin]], ties to [[Ungaethram]]
		3. 

# PROJECT ELVES

Make elves cool and old-tolkein-esq; good crafters and enchanters - similar with dwarves; next to do - but they got hit hard eary with [[The Old|Minyostalma]] and the [[50 Year Fires]]
