# CURRENT NOTES

I want to make the lore of my world cool and interactive. [[Historical Markings]] on weapons, armor, and other items of importance or value such as coins or paintings are a great idea. #npc characters should make passing remarks about #loreful happenings and characters. Firsthand #text accounts are useful to flesh out these ideas, but cannot be the only way the lore is delivered. Ideally, the story we tell at the table aligns with the story I tell you about this world, and the characters and groups our players interact with should interact with the lore as well. Given that this is a living document, and one that is quite young, we are only at the beginning stages of that idea.

What if [[Kakurak]] died and turned into a lich's pet?

Blood of [[Travis]]; "Blood of a brother..."

[[The Pantheon#Sama]] takes Amashod if she goes down in a fight around here.

# NEXT SESSION

Okay. Lets use our map and our table to make some cool scenes as they travel the underdark. make it wierd, make it fun, but make it hell. 

take their food
poison them
give them disease
crush them with rocks

make it clear that it is hard to stay alive down here

show how hard it is for other people to stay alive down here - our heroes are struggling less

"Bones on the floor. An echoing drip that gets louder and quieter for hours on end as you travel. Your feet are tired. You've been walking for hours. Another crunch. Bones on the floor."

# PROJECT ELVES

Make elves cool and old-tolkein-esq; good crafters and enchanters - similar with dwarves; next to do - but they got hit hard eary with [[The Old|Minyostalma]] and the [[50 Year Fires]]
