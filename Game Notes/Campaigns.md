Evocative Title: **"The War For the Holyl'nds"**
Description: *'The year is 106 AF, and life is tougher than usual in the North. Gromosh smiles upon the havoc he rakes upon the face of our world.

The Guilds are broken. What is a hero in the decline of our world?'*

Evocative Title: **"The Ancient Empire's Mysteries"**
Description: *'I don't know what year it is. The folks that come are saying we're past a century. I've been here over a decade and I still don't understand this place. I know I'm not long for this world, but I'll be damned if I don't figure Minyostalma somehow in my head.'*

Evocative Title: **"The Gameshow from Hell"**

Some of us are losing faith that he still speaks to us - that the High Ambassador does speak the truth for Him. The rest of us know his return to be coming.'*
