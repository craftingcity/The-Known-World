# The Jarl of the Grungarian Frost Giant Clan

Grungar is the Jarl of an Frost Giant clan. He operates in an unnamed portion of the [[The Planes of Existence#Great Glacier|Great Glacier]] in the [[The Planes of Existence#The Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]]. 

[[Jarl Grungar]]'s War/Peace Goals:

- Escape the Ordening (mostly via leaving the elemental planes)
- Fight and Hunt (within a territory is acceptable, unrestricted prefered.)
- Be well fed and respected (we can fight about that; we're giants)
- Get shinies (jewelry/gems ONLY, minted peices are less useful to us)
