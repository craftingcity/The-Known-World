### Background
#### Early Life
As a pup, Kakurak was born to a young mother who died shortly after his brother Luzikiemal was born. Together, the bronze dragons sought life's experience, and explored the world. Legend has it that they even braved the darkness of [[Kailkeep]]. Luzikiemal was a brash younger brother that Kakurak wishes not to speak of. "He is no longer." is all he would reply.
