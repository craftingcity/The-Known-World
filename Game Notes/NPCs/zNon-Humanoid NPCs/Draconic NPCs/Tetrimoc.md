# Tetrimoc, the Progenitor
One of the first dragons to fall from the heavens, and one of the first sentient beings to record a textual history of the world: [[Tetrimoc's Journal]]

This Ancient Yellow Dragon is a deity to some, a leader to others, and "a safe ruler in an otherwise harsh natured [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc|desert]]".

# A great mystery
Very very few know the true nature of the dragon. The copy of his journal that is distributed en mass as holy text may not be as real as some say.

He has not been seen in many years. Not so many that people have forgotten that he is real, but so many that babies have been born who have not seen him fly. 

Much iconography can be seen of him in [[The Golden City]], and his wealth and glory and benevolence is mentioned in most text found in the desert. 

[[Golden Claws]] rule [[The Golden City]] in his name.
