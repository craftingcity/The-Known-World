#### VO EXAMPLE:

> A yellow dragonborn stands in a dark brown robe with red bordering and filigree.

Venclaw is the High Ambassador of the [[Golden Claws]]. Their public function in this structure is, supposedly, to speak with [[Tetrimoc]] on the current on-goings of [[The Golden City]], [[Lands of Tetrimoc]], and greater [[Alaturmen]]. 

Their true function is the "face" of the [[Golden Claws#The Council of Eight]]; they make a show to the public of the Council's decisions.
