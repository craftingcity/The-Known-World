### Mannerism & Disposition
Phnipper was as cheerful as she was intelligent. She lacked wisdom, but only insomuch as she felt there was little that magic could not be made to do.
### Background
#### Early Life
Born and raised in the [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples|Combine]]; Phnipper hails specifically from the city of [[Beacon]]. After years of studying magic there, she travelled to the [[Coalition City]] and began to work in the [[Guild of Wizards]] as a liason with the [[Guild of Adventurers]], where she met her husband, [[Dimble Turing]]. After spending over a half century with eachother, the two parted ways in search of adventure, but both made promise to return to the other.

After finding her wanderlust, she met the other members of the [[Grey Ordeal]], as described in [[Paulo San Tymiq]]'s [[The Ballad of Grey Ordeal]], and begun her greater adventures which eventually culminated in the [[First Invasion of Orcus]], the death of [[Tubric Millstone Wrinsmith]], and the retirement of the Grey Ordeal.

Late in her life, she donated her and her husband's horde of magical and material wealth to the [[Kakurak|First Great Adventurer Dragon]] before the two moved into a cabin in the [[Wetfoot Greenland]].
