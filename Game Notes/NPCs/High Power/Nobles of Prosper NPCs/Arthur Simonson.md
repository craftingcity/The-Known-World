# Arthur "Artie" Simonson
## The Great Liberator, 
## The Adventurer King, 
## (and so on)
### he/him

> A tall well kept half-hobgoblin-human man with dark curly hair. He wears a set of leather armor underneath a large blue royal coat. Atop his head sits a platinum circlet spiked with gold.

Arthur is an un-aging adventurer king. He holds many [[#Titles]], which [[Balthazar Wumfingle|his attendant]] refuses not to say, but prefers to be known to his friends as Artie.

He is happy to work with known adventurers and has many agents within the [[Guild of Adventurers]] to keep an eye on new talent and important plots.

## History

Artie "fell into" becoming the King of [[The Kingdom of Prosper|Prosper]]; As a youngling, he saw the horrors of the uncivilized world. He used this to fuel his passion for adventure and when he came of age, he [[Unification|liberated]] the many holdings in the [[The Kingdom of Prosper|northeast]]. These holdings heralded him as their savior and, needing new management, he became their King.

He has, during his rule, shaped his new kingdom into an honest, hard-working, and fairly equitable place. He heralds progress so-far-unseen by any other faction in [[Alaturmen]], specifically regarding military-magical technology.

Having sent expeditions out to many locations across the land, including [[The Old]] and [[Kailkeep]], he has been cited for abuse by the [[Guild of Adventurers]] and has poor standing with them. 

## Location
Arthur lives in his holding, [[Castle Prosper]], with his lovers. Long ago, he lived with the remaining members of [[Simonson's Adventuring Party|his adventuring party]], but they are since dead of old age or otherwise.

## Statistics
Arthur is, at base, a CR 9 ["Champion Warrior"](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/npc/champion-warrior/). His weapons is a *longsword +3*; "Magni Liberatoris Nostri Temporis". He wears a *belt of unnatural strength* that sets his Strength to 24, and a *ring of mind shielding* that houses no other soul and is kept invisible unless otherwise stated. His curse provides him with the mechanical effects of a *ring of regeneration*.

He wears a signet ring that bares the [[Seal of Kingdom Prosper]]. His "[[Novum Caput Dei]]" is a circlet made of a band of platinum and gold and is politically invaluable, but could theoretically be sold as scrap for some 1,500 pp.
