# Killrick Emm Glask
## "Honorable" Baron of [[Eastlick Mossland]] and the [[Riphounds]]
### he/her
#### VO EXAMPLE:

![[Baron Glask VOX.webm]]


> A beautifully crafted muscular form emerges from behind the styled door. Her dark pony-tailed hair flows long behind him. Her every muscle flexes as he walks calmly over. She is dressed past the nines and beyond the tens. He is beautiful. She is gradient. You behold the Baron Killrick Emm Glask.

Killrick is the Baron of the "Middle" Eastlick

While the Baron puts on a kind demeanor, Killrick Emm Glask has earned his name. She has no trouble removing pieces from the gameboard – personally - and no trouble moving morality to suit his needs – or whoever's paying her.

## Goals
The Baron Glask wishes to expand the territory of the [[Riphounds]].

Killrick wishes to hunt [[Baron Xuiop]] for his pelt; he thinks it would make a nice warm cape.

How that goal could resolve when it is achieved (or failed, if this is considered a genuine possibility).
