## History
### Early Life
Born to the elven family Cassindil only a dozen years after the fall of [[Tetrimoc]], Yassir is a second generation elf, born in [[Aeberu]] to two parents who survived the [[Great Fires]].

As a child, Yassir was told of the tales of [[The Old|Minyostalma]] and their great centers of trade, knowledge, and charity. As they grew on the streets of [[Aeberu]], they gained the trust of their peers who themselves controlled enterprises that began to grow. Soon Yassir began to have powerful friends. Before they could become more than a known entity, Baron [[Arroit Jammu]] exiled him from the [[Grumbling Hills]], sundering his efforts in the regions.

Many allies of Yassir were quite perturbed by Arroit's decision, and joined in the pursuit of new lands to hold. This caravan of individuals, communities, and enterprises began to homogenize into what we know now as the [[Grovetenders]]. This new faction began to either remove or integrate the native residents of the [[Southern Third]] into their new community.

### A True Barony
Since becoming the Baron of the Southern Third in 0XXAF, they cultivated a culture of internal positivity, and famously adopted the Yellow Mage, [[Nicolas Talaveem]], among many others displaced by the [[Great Fires]]. This "adoption" was often more ceremonial or practical than legal; the "children" of the Cassindil family were welcome to use the resources and reputation that came with that title.
