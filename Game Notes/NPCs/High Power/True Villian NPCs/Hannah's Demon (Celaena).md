![[celeana.png]]
> A wine purple demon with dark red horns and eyes, she wears a elegant midnight-sky-black dual-slit dress that shines in the torchlight of the room. She lazily holds a dark black sword in her hand, while grasping the hand of the woman beside her with the other (because she's Gay).

Celaena is an end-game level threat aligned with the [[Demon Lords]]. 

She is looking to induce an era of Chaos in Alaturmen, and would like to do so in such a way that allows her to stay in power and control. While not strictly necessary, Celaena would like to take her choice(s) of personal attendant from the current population who would prove their worth to her.
