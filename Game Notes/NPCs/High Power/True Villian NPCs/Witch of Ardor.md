The Witch of Ardor made a deal with the patriarch of [[The Arstoviches]] for power in exchange for his child. Unspecified, and therefore interpreted in its broadest meaning. After his natural death, she erased his name and cursed his children's bloodline â€“ and after the turn of the half-century, the Arstoviches became the first of Alaturmen cursed with Vamparism.

Though the Witch died not long after her work was completed, by [[Arthur Simonson]]'s hand, her spirit was not satisfied, and she now resides as a haunting presence in the Outskirts of [[Aurgurs]], withering with time.
