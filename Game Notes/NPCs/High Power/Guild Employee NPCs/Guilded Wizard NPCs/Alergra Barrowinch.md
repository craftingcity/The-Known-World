## History
Alergra is a genius. She does not plan well, but she was one of the few who has mastered magic from very few examples.

Early in her life, she was shut into her home, her mother and father were very poor, and could not afford to send her to any school. As she grew in age and creativity, she found ways of avoiding her chores and opted to rather travel into the forest to explore for new hiding spots to read. 

She is missing years of her life that she cannot remember in the forests, only bits and pieces. She hopes to return these memories to herself one day.
