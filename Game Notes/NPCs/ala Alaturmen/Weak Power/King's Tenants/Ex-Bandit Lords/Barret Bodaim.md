# Barret "Brains" Bodaim
## New Bandit Lord
### he/they

> A sanguine predator dressed in a dark brown cloak bearing the word "Bodaim" in black embroidery. Underneath this cloak, this man wears refurbished studded leather armor. In his hands, his longsword warbles the surrounding air.

Barret is the son of [[Edward Bodaim]] and [[Griss'eltel Bodaim]]. He escaped persecution for his fathers crimes and followed in his footsteps, as encouraged by his mother.

## Goals
Barret wants more than anything to be a good father, like he never could have. He thinks that he can be a great father if he's really powerful, so he builds his power in his gang of thieves.

## History
Barret came from the idea of a bandit using his son as bait.

## Location
Barret can be found with his bandits, and generally, they work in the south-west of Prosper.

Currently, Barret's home-base is set up in the hills by the Highway heading into [[Coalition City]] - a prime hunting blind.
