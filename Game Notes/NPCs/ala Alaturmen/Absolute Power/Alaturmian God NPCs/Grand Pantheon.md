# Gods by Plane
## Gods of Alaturmen
The pantheon of gods on this place is not like those in the stories of Olympus. Gods are born from people, not the other way around. Gods need worshipers. Often, in exchange, they will do some work. The oldest gods of this place are the gods of emotion. Few people of this world do not worship some kind of god. We can see them, and we can influence them. They exist. Fewer still worship only one god, as no single gods favor is truly enough in this world.

### Emotional Gods
All of these gods are born of the feeling of emotion. As these gods made themselves known, they gained followers, and harvested their Faith. In trade, they offer their favor in the form of divine magic.

#### Ar'kraven 
- sadness, death, grief, emptiness, void; a group of vultures picking the flesh from a corpse

#### Sune
- love, ecstasy, beauty, artistry; a middle aged redhead with a knack for painting

#### Tauruin
- fear, power, suppression, dominance, pride; a lone king with subjects grovelling at their feet

#### Gromosh
- anger/rage, hatred, battle and war; an old orc who simply refuses to die without a fight
##### Gish, Wife of Gromosh
- battle and war, magic, destructive evocation; and old orc who smiles with arcane intent
- some claim Gish to be simply an interpretation of Gromosh, and others claim her to be her own entity

#### Freric and Sophie
- surprise, mischief, childishness, longing; a pair of young twins with nothing to lose but each other

#### Blemon
- loathing, disgust, disease; a green half masked figure in a dark robe holding a rotting wooden staff


### Physical Idols
Born from the corpse of [[All-Father Annam]], these idols of the elements rule physicality on [[Alaturmen]].

#### Terran
- earth

#### Ventan
- wind

#### Ignan 
- fire

#### Aquan 
- water

#### Animan
- magic, weave
- Animan was the Idol that bore arcane magic into the minds of the fresh noids of Alaturmen.

### Patrons of Need
Often, someone needs a god's help, and noone can pick up the divine phone. When this happens, a patron of need will step in and answer the call to the best of their ability. These are the most common household gods.
