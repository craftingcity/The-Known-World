Its Greatness is the White Flame in this area's name. It is the white flame seen in the many cities of this place. It is seen wherever there is but should not be a great human triumph in [[The Holyl'nds]] and wherever this land perseveres even given its scars.

## The Flame
The flame itself has no name, and will only be called Its Greatness. It has not revealed its age, or place of origin. It has not and will never verbally communicate. When you look into the flame, it can make you feel, and if you respond, so will it. 

### For the Many
Its Greatness is simply a deity, not a god. It would not show itself in any capacity other than that which its patron's show it off. When it wishes, or is perhaps satisfied, it would perform a small act, so normal that it goes unnoticed except by the faithful.

This is enough for them.

### For the Few

It's Greatness is a [Patron](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock) for some few. Its magic is a great burning. It gives and it takes. Power, on loan, with interest. No questions asked. The people of [[The Church of the White Flame]] call these people Spoken because of misconception and tradition. 

Those who know It's true goals know that It is the progenitor God of Human Righteousness.
