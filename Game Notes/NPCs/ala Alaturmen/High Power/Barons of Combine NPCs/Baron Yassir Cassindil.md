## History
Born to the elven family Cassindil, one of the ancient houses of [[The Old|Minyostalma]], Yassir is a second generation elf, born in the [[Grumbling Hills]].

As a child, Yassir was told of the tales of [[The Old|Minyostalma]] and their great centers of trade, knowledge, and charity. As they grew on the streets of [[Aeberu]], they gained the trust of their peers that controlled enterprises that began to grow, and soon Yassir began to have powerful friends. Before they could become more than a known entity, [[Baron Jammu]] exiled him from the hills, sundering his efforts in the [[Grumbling Hills]].

Yassir now holds the Barony of the [[Southern Third]]
