### she/her
> Amethyst stands stout on her throne and strokes her 6-inch beard as she looks at you thoughtfully. On her body, she wears a dark blue cloak and a comfortable and fine set of leather-protected clothing. She wears an amulet of amethyst emblem around her neck, which, when it catches the light just perfectly, you can see is embossed with the Hillkeep emblem.

### Background
#### Early Life

As a young dwarf, Amethyst Jammu was solely purposed with becoming a suitable heir to the throne of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]]. This was a position she molded into comfortably, though she still holds some resentment for her older mentors for expunging certain aspects of her younger personality.

Amethyst's father was King of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]] and Baron of the [[Grumbling Hills]] for nearly a full century before he was assassinated by a xenophobic group of human militants who apposed the integration of the southern [[Castle Darnt]] into the Kingdom. After his assassination, the remnants of his cabinet regrouped, demolished the xenophobic militants, and installed Amethyst as the new Baron. 

For as long as she has been alive, she has been groomed to be the ruler of the [[Dwarven Kingdom Jammu]] after her father's death, and an advisor to a Human Baron, if such an occurrence comes to pass.

#### New Baron Jammu

Amethyst Jammu is the current Baron of the [[Grumbling Hills]] and the surrounding areas. She is currently the monarch of the [[Darnt Hillkeep]]. She is currently in attempts to maintain her newfound control over her domain, especially in the [[Northern Third]]'s less-than-Loyalist holdings.
