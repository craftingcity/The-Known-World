# Paulo San Tymiq

> An old human man with features that tell the tale of a warm and kind man who has worked for all his life. A stringed instrument hangs to his back.

An old bard, and one who was known to tell no embellishes or lies. Since his death, many written stories have been accounted or retold based on his words.


## History
Paulo was born into Alaturmen on the 14th of First Melt, 34 years after Tetrimoc fell as a second-generation human. He grew to appreciate the importance of story and history by the time he came of age, he claimed to owe it to elven influence during his youth. After some time pursuing this career to mild success, Paulo wrote and orated [[The Ballad of Grey Ordeal]], and this largely reportive story became known in all Alaturmen.

After this, he wrote many more influential pieces during his time as a bard. Including tales depicting [[Nine Hells of Baator|Baator]]

While some tales say that Paulo was slain in a glorious battle, the rumors are not true. He settled down in [[Four Stone]], and died peacefully around friends in 098AF at 64 years old.
