# Kakurak, the Arbitrator, the First Great Adventurer Dragon

![[kakurak.jpg]]

Kakurak is a bronze dragon who offers his allyship to those who would do it well and good. He is the First Great Adventurer Dragon. His truest allies are bound to him by boon. 

As a pup, Kakurak was born to a young mother who died shortly after his brother Luzikiemal was born. Together, the bronze dragons sought life's experience, and explored the world. Legend has it that they even braved the darkness of [[Kailkeep]]. Luzikiemal was a brash younger brother that Kakurak wishes not to speak of. "He is no longer." is all he would reply. 

[[Kakurak's Lair]] in the northwest of [[The Holyl'nds]], above the great [[Firelight Sea]].
