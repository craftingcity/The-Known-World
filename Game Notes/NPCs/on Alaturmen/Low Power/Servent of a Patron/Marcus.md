# Marcus

> A tall satyr wearing a brown vest, a white blindfold and his furs. Visually timid, he's usually very happy when Kakurak's Champions come around, as he can often find conversation at the least from some of them.  

Marcus is [[Kakurak]]'s blind autistic satyr assistant. He cooks, cleans, and runs errands for his Master. He is often the dragon's "personal face" for official meetings and such when [[Kakurak|he]] cannot attend in person. He hates this position only slightly less than he loves Kakurak.
