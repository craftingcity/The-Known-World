# Gods of Alaturmen

The pantheon of gods on this place is not like those in the stories of Olympus. Gods are born from people, not the other way around. Gods need worshipers. Often, in exchange, they will do some work. The oldest gods of this place are the gods of emotion.

Few people of this world do not worship some kind of god. We can see them, and we can influence them. They exist. Fewer still worship only one god, as no single gods favor is truly enough in this world. So they say.

## Emotional Gods
All of these gods are born of the feeling of emotion. Because of the Weave of this land, these emotions bore gods. And soon, these gods gathered followers. 

#### Ar'kraven 
- sadness, death, grief, emptiness, void; a group of vultures picking the flesh from a corpse

#### Sune
- love, ecstasy, beauty, artistry; a middle aged redhead with a knack for painting

#### Tauruin
- fear, power, suppression, dominance, pride; a lone king with subjects grovelling at their feet

#### Gromosh
- anger/rage, hatred, battle and war; an old orc who simply refuses to die without a fight

#### Freric and Sophie
- surprise, mischief, childishness, longing; a pair of young twins with nothing to lose but each other

#### Blemon
- loathing, disgust, disease; a green half masked figure in a dark robe holding a rotting wooden staff


## Physical Idols
These are the gods of material. They are what we touch and breathe. Each of the physical idols are both an entity unto themselves and a piece of a larger whole: [[The Planes of Existence#Prime|The Prime Material Plane]].

#### Terran
- earth

#### Ventan
- wind

#### Ignan 
- fire

#### Aquan 
- water

#### Animan
- magic, weave
- Animan was the Idol that bore arcane magic into the minds of the fresh noids of Alaturmen.

## Patrons of Need
Often, someone needs a god's help, and noone can pick up the divine phone. When this happens, a patron of need will step in and answer the call to the best of their ability. They are the household gods.

#### Sama
- the god of One Mindedness.
- feels like sitting in a rainy forest
- smells of wet moss, fresh dirt
- Sama appears to their followers as a figure cloaked in dark green or blue or brown, and does not speak. their face or head cannot be perceived
- they are not easily amused

#### Yamisch
- the god of true vision
- feels like the best trip you've ever had
- smells of blueberry, honey
- Yamish appears to their followers as a map or scroll that has too much detail / knowledge

#### Certi'alkior
- the god of a quick death
- feels like warm blood and cold steel
- smells of sweat, gunpowder
- Certi'alkior appears to their followers in battle before their final stand, though seeing her is not considered a holy sentence to death

## Gods of Triumph
Some creatures of this place have become so powerful that they have become god-like, and their rules begin to change. They need worshipers like any other god, but unlike others, their power comes from the stories people tell about them.
