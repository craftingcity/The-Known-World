# Snure
## King
### he/him

> A towering man, nearly 30 feet tall, made of flame and molten rock. He wears a large golden crown with many hundreds of fine jewels. At his side, he carries a large adamentine warhammer.

King Snure leads both the Revolt against the Ordening and [[The Assault of the Giant Decenters]]. 

He wishes for power only slightly more than he loves wealth.

## History
For the purpose of a speedy beginning to a campaign, King Snure was born in Module. Now he has other giants serve his needs from his throne on the [[Plane of Fire]]. He met another whom he loved. Together they had child; [[Prince Bissk]]. Bissk suggested the use of the rare material [[Durandurm]] as a kind of weaponry, and he presented his father with a war-machine that used this material.

Snure knew he must have this tool of war, and with it, he would become unstoppable. He gathered allies and resources by making promises he fully intended to break at his whim, but his son brought him dire news. While construction could begin immediately, a series of raids on the newest plane of the multiverse may be immediately necessary, as the supplies of the Giant Decenters were not high in [[Durandurm]].

He gathered two others â€“ the Chief Whats-His-Name and the [[Jarl Grungar]]. Together, they invaded the plane of [[Alaturmen - Prime Material Plane]] using the Drow Magic of [[The Whitimores]].

King Snures goals remain incomplete, as of writing, but he draws closer with each passing hour. Construction has been unable to be interrupted as of yet, and Snure's influence has held fast against the counter attack in [[Baskin]].

## Location
