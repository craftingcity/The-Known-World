# Nicolas Talaveem
## Keeper of Darktower
#### he/him/his

> A man of worn face and dark eyes. Perhaps his body is some 70 years, but his [[Marked By the Fire|soul bears a dark ancient mark]]. He wears a gray cloak around his thin form. He holds a crooked staff of dark wood. It bears a crack that emits a dull arcane light.

Nicolas is a first-generation human. He was born to two [[Human Specifics|Fieldborn]] who lived in a human settlement under the protection of [[The Old|Minyostalma]]. He was orphaned by the [[50 Year White Burning]], and was of the few who were spared in the event. He was adopted by [[Baron Yassir Cassindil|a family of elves]] that collected orphaned survivors of their [[The Old|psuedo-ancestral home]].

## History
As a child, Nicolas witnessed a horrible holy act, the [[50 Year White Burning]]. He was [[Marked By the Fire]]. His adoptive family, the [[Baron Yassir Cassindil|Cassindils]], took him to their lands in the [[Grumbling Hills]] where he grew up in a small hamlet near [[Aeberu]].

Under the sponsorship and watch of the Cassindil family, Nicolas began to learn the sport of wand-weaving and quickly became a formidable opponent. 

As Nicolas began to reach adulthood, he was at the top of the wand-weaving game. He felt that no opponent could match him. He used his connections to the Cassindil family to begin to collect a personal collection of arcane texts of various sources. He was soon approached by [[The Wizard In Blue]], and was convinced to join the [[Guild of Wizards]]. Nicolas hides as much of his knowledge from his peers as he can.

Nicolas used the principles he used in wand-weaving to being to craft his own magics, creating personal spells and wards. He has been seeking the greatest boon - eternal life.

> Perhaps some alteration of the Magic Jar concept. I would need someone's assistance in transportation. That may only be a temporary solution.
