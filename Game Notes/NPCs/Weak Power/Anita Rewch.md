# Anita Rewch
## Research Assistant
### she/her

> A timid, comfortably dressed human woman wearing thick glasses quickly fidgets with the overly cute doll in her hands.

Anita is a senior in her class at [[Jade Ward#The Center of Arcane Education]], and was spending some amount of time as a live-in research assistant to [[Otto Malkovich]] in exchange for class credits and a wage, but is now travelling with [[The Secretkeepers]] - mostly of her own free will.

## Roleplaying
### "Oh, uh... Yeah- Well... Yes, but I- I think actually..."

### Mannerism & Disposition
Anita is...
	- **TIMID**, preferring not to be noticed when able
	- **RATIONAL**, providing of feasible and realistic concepts
	- **INVENTIVE**, reaching forward beyond culture's conception

### Background
#### Early Life
Anita was born in [[Coalition City]], in the Producing of 84AF, to a relatively large family. While she was growing up, her parent's lack of time for their eldest child led her to explore her world on her own. The world scared her, but a sense of understanding would ease that fear. 

#### College
Since her adolescence, she has attempted to form and reshape her understanding of the world as she gathers more and more information. As her information hunt progressed, she joined [[Jade Ward#The Center of Arcane Education]], and was eventually pressured into an internship with [[Otto Malkovich]] to finish her thesis and graduate, when she encountered the [[The Secretkeepers]].

#### Adventure
Her thesis is presented in the form of a spell (backed with her theory and research, of course) that will, once complete, present its caster with information on the status of a target's Faith relations.
