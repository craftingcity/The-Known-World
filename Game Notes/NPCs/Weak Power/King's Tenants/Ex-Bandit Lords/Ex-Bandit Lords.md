The Bandit Lords were an ancient collection of ruling bandits and raiders who ruled in the [[Great Northern Forests]] before they were destroyed by both the [[Great Fires]] and the [[Unification]]. There were many, too many to know or count. Those few who's name is still whispered upon the winds of this land are mere legends to the children of today, their threat no longer a reality.
