# Griss'eltel Bodaim
## Elder Bandit Lady
### she/her

> A sweetly looking woman in her late 70s wearing a plain brown cloak over her old and poor-fitting leather armor.

The wife of [[Edward Bodaim]] and the mother of his child, [[Barret Bodaim]], and the elder of his gang of thieves. She, filled with rage, enchant-cursed a longsword that she gave to her son.

## Goals
Really, she wants her Son to have a good life, but the way that she thinks that needs to be done is by Barret becoming the leader of this massive gang and taking back the Castle Prosper, just like his daddy.

How that goal could resolve when it is achieved (or failed, if this is considered a genuine possibility).

## History
A son needs a mother.

## Location
Griss'eltel is found at the home-camp of [[Barret Bodaim]]'s bandits.

## Statistics
Their game statistics, including any items that may change them or any items of interest to the players, a ring of keys for example.
