> Boxtext for an action, outfit, and a physical trait.

Ondo is a negligently profitable merchant that, due to his connections and ability to consistently provide goods, runs the Rookie Village as a minor autocrat.

## Roleplaying
### "There are rules to be respected, and many of them are the ones I made, how would I look if I were to ever bend them for anyone?"

### Mannerism & Disposition
Ondo speaks slowly and joyfully until it is time to speak about business - then he is slow and firm, but never is he unkind. Ondo primarily cares for his business. Ondo secondarily cares for the people under his protection or control. Ondo does not care for much else.
