Amashod whats your passive perception?

You spot something. Up ahead, poking out of the tunnel. You see a figure... in a dark cloak... it doesn't look like they were trying to hide per se but it looks more like they didn't expect you to see them. 

You don't exactly recognize them, you can't even see their face really. They point to something deeper into the chamber. Do you look?



You have been starving for some days now. 

Amashod, you see the figure again. It waits until you stop before turning from the wall it was leaning on and emits a strange call. The rest of you hear this too. From the darkness you hear a clomping. With a strange haste and determination, a buck with large heavy antlers comes sprinting up to you, and as it reaches you it skids to a stop before seemingly coming out of something.
