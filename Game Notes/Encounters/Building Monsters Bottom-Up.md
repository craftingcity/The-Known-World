**Simple Monster Building**  
  
Start with a CR. Your CR determines your proficiency bonus and your MBP (monster building point) budget.  
  
You get 14 **MBP** "base" plus 4 **MBP** for every CR up to 20, and 12 for every CR beyond 19. (CR 20+ monsters get 3xs of HP and damage per additional CR in DMG chart)  
  
You also get 1 bonus **MBP** at CR 5, 11, and 17 (because I needed a few more **MBP** at 20 to make the math work, and doing it at the tier barriers makes sense).  
  
Now work out the monster's stats.  
  
**For Free you get:**  
0 standard attack  
10 AC  
10(+0) in your attack stat (spellcasting stat, or weapon)  
0 HP  
  
A base template, to start with something halfway usable, might be:  
12 standard attack damage (4)  
13 AC (3)  
16 in your attack stat (3)  
32 HP (4)  
This costs you your 14 "free" **MBP.**  
  
To calculate your attack bonus/save DCs, use your attack stat plus your proficiency bonus.  
  
Note that your attack stat, if it adds to damage, must be paid for in the damage calculation.  
  
Now you spend your **MBP**s:  
  
**Things to buy:**  
- 8 HP for each 1 **MBP**  
- +/- 1 AC for +/- 1 **MBP** (can even sell AC! But don't go crazy.)  
- +3 standard attack routine damage for 1 **MBP**  
- +3 legendary action/off turn/bonus attack damage for 1 **MBP** (total damage; 3 legendary actions doing 10 each is 30/3 = 10 MBP)  
- +2 primary attack/save DC attribute (a +1 attribute modifier) for 1 **MBP** (or -2 to get 1 back). (if you have more than one, average them. If one is used way more than the other, ignore the other one).  
- 9 points of single-use damage for 1 **MBP**. If this replaces your standard attack attack routine, only pay for the damage difference.  
- A save proficiency is 1 **MBP**.  
- Legendary resists cost 2 **MBP** for the first, then 1 for each one afterwards (up to 3).  
- Significant resistances/immunities doubles the cost of buying HP (or more or less)  
- Significant vulnerabilities halves HP cost  
- Flying at or under 9 CR is worth 2 **MBP**  
  
Attacks that are area effects (1/2 damage on save) should be assumed to hit more than 1 target; multiply their effective damage before calculating their cost.  
  
Various other abilities have costs. You can wing it, or you can look them up in the monster building rules in the DMG and translate it to AC/ATK (at 1 **MBP** per AC/ATK).
