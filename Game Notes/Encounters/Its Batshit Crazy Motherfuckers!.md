The Its Batshit Crazy Motherfuckers! are a group of bandits and mauraders who kill and steal for fun and profit.

Before every engagement one screams their name.

1 flyer
	A tiefling with giant bat-like wings; Screamer, because it screams the thing. Clearly here for its own version of a good time not a long time.
1 sniper
	A not-so-badass old dwarven wizard with a long and poor reputation with any kind of good or law.
2 muscle
	A dragonborn greaser and a mostly-present midranger - drow artillery? They're both reasonably nice unless they need to posture or you start shit.
1 speed
	A deepgnome rogue. Really shitty to be around. Always keeps his word.
1 brains (caster?)
	A drow gish. Shes cool and badass when she robs you. Overworked by this shitty crew, but they're family.
