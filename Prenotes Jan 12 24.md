### Intro

When last we left our heroes they had made meeting with a powerful Dragon by the name [[Kakurak]], and spent time in his lair. 

A kind soul, he equipped the party with knowledge of a horrible place of power and some manner of physical equipment as well. Your path ahead may be full of danger, but you are a worthy band. 

What do you do? Who leads the convoy?
