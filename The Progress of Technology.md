title: Era of the Druid
content:

	In the Era of the Druid, the first advances were born; as the Druids mastered the latent magic in Alaturmen, the world quickly took to agriculture, metallurgy, and linguistics. The elves brought more advanced technologies to the world, at least in the north-west, before the Flame took their lives and buried their technologies.

	The technology in this time is roughly equivilent to a range from the 'Neolithic Ages' to the 'Iron Ages'.

Additionally, the beginnings of an understanding of magic had turned many scholars towards wizardry, alchemistry, or theology, and brought the marriage of magic and mechanic.
