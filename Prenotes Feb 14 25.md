### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had ventured into the [[The Old|Minyostalma Blockade and Exclusion District]] on the advice of 22, or 'Zipper' as they are known here, having told the rest of you that the reward is in fact worth the risk. Having entered through the Western Gate, you travelled into the Cordon to gather supplies and a paying job before then heading beyond.

Find a paying job you did - an open contract on the WhiteTech Bounty-Board paying 12 coin-credits for the recovery and upload of Cpl. Lazarus' PDA data. Following information indicating the Cpl. and his teammates last reported from the north-eastern half of the Village, you and your party headed south, but before you could arrive at the Village proper, you were accosted by a group of chitin-wearing, carbine-wielding bandits.

The burning smell of spent durandurm fills the air, and your muscles ache of combat. The bodies of the bandits lay before you, eight in total. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
##### Of Bandits and Bodies
- 8x Chitin Armor (scrap)
- 6x Steel Machete
- 8x Durandurm Carbine
- 13x DRM, WB
- 1x PDA, Damaged

##### The Squad lost in the Village
Cpl. Lazarus, Pvt. Yohian, and Pvt. Steward are members of *Disciple-5*, which was recently forced to disperse during an operation in [[The Places...#The City]]. These three last reported from the [[The Places...#The Villas (4/rr)]], after which they encountered a minefield, where their remains now rest. Cpl. Lazarus and Pvt. Yohian were both killed by the explosion, and Pvt. Steward sustained critical injuries, from which he has been attempting to recover for the last 24 hours.

```

	- Scraps of P. Combat Armor
	- Broken Carbine
	- Simple Anti-Rad Box > Spiral Eye
