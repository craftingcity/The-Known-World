### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had ventured into the [[The Old|Minyostalma Blockade and Exclusion District]] on the advice of 22, or 'Zipper' as they are known here, having told the rest of you that the reward is in fact worth the risk. Having entered through the Western Gate, you travelled into the Cordon to gather supplies and a paying job before then heading beyond.

Following information indicating the Cpl. and his teammates last reported from the north-eastern half of the Village, you and your party headed south, but before you could arrive at the Village proper, you were accosted by a group of chitin-wearing, carbine-wielding bandits.
