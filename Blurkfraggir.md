# Description
The duergar that live here were once found by a group of humans that mined into the underdark. They have been hunted by Illithid as of late.

The duergar in Blurkfraggir are devot Brandist. They hold their slaves on their bodies as brands on their arms.
## Physicality of the Holding
Blurkfraggir is pitched into a deep pocket, some thousand feet deep. Many bridges of moss-rope and barrelstalk span the tunnels of this settlement. 

## Population Distribution
Nearly 100% deurgar. They hold goblin and human slaves, 50% each. 

## Notable Locations
Many places of industry and metallurgy, the duergar make homes here too. 

A tavern in the center of town is kept by a family of duergar.
