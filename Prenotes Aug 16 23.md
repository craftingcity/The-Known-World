### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were shrouded in darkness. You do not know how long you were unconscious, but as you return to reality, you find yourselves drenched in warm sunlight and wet sand. You four have awoken to the sight of tall trees creating a thin canopy here at the riverbank. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

They re-entry on AN19, which is as-of-yet undeveloped. The World Date is 03-25-0105.

We're mostly looking to push any kind of personal questline, but here are some backups;

Baron Avory has interest in Daelith

Baron Xuiop does not approve of visitors, and will send a hunting party to the newcomers.
