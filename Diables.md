# Description
Any sort of local lore...

Diables is the domain of [[Noble House a'Haruuc]].

The communications from Diables have been failing to reach their destination as of late. A fey has come to Diables and is playing a trick on the residents here - everyone is reacting funny, so they are inclined to continue.
## Physicality of the Holding
Diables' position near the lakes of southern Prosper allow many of the structures to be constructed of mud as well as wood. Much of the open area behind the buildings are training grounds.

## Population Distribution
If it differs from the nation's...

## Defenses

## Notable Locations
Including both locations in the holding and around it, such as "the cave three miles southwest" or "Jimmy's potion shop in the Foire District"...
