### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had performed their duty under contract with [[Web Spun Solutions]] by defending themselves and Edgars' cart against a group of more than pushy Northern Liberationists aiming to seize it under their anti-war moral superiority.

Moral superiority falters in the face of slashing steel.

The days after your encounter were tense, for Edgars if not the rest of you, but you encountered no resistance on your next few runs between Mining Colony 15 and [[Mountain Hall]]. A section of the worker barracks has been reserved at the Colony, and the five of you have come to a greater sense of comfortability with each other and your place of work.

We return to the party a week after we last saw them, for today is the 8th of Producing - and your first payday. You have spent the morning and afternoon riding in the empty bed of Edgars' Cart towards the [[Web Spun Solutions]] depot in [[Mountain Hall]], where you are due to collect your week's wages.

The rhythmic rumble of the cart-wheels against the rough-hewn road begins to slow before it takes a sharp left and quickly halts. The depot stands before you, a small two-story building stands boldly on the edge of this thoroughfare, and painted in deep purple paint against the yellow stone - "Web Spun Solutions, Connecting Business in the Deakred Range since 105AF". Edgars dismounts and begins to walk inside.

### What does the World Know?
Each of our "mercs" receive 79sp, 8cp for their weekly wages, plus a 25sp Hazard Pay, for a total of 104 sp, 8cp. The one dwarf working in the depot is named Horbart Youngkeeper, and was hired on the same 13-week schedule as the rest of the WSS crew.

When each "merc" returns to their room, they may find something interesting...
- Eve will find a formal letter upon her pillow;
	"Laush.   
	  My name is Hedwig a'Alden, I am the Count of the Second Duche of Yerba, and I need your help. 
	  I knew your mother when she was a Captain in the Civil Peacekeepers of [[Bandeer]], and I knew she would do great things. Thankfully, years later, here you are, in the right place at the right time. 
	  There is a faction of people in the Range that are under the belief that we, the Kingdom of Prosper, are acting in error and should return to peace. 
	  These people have begun to make their dissatisfaction clear to the People of Prosper. I need to know who's burning our crops, and I need to know who gave that order. You are the citizen we need to perform this task. 
	  Prepare a report of valuable and actionable information and deliver it to me at my manor in [[Bandeer]]. Your country will reward your courage."
	
- Thomas will find a hidden letter under the candlestick on his nightstand;
"T.
  Tasking-level Command; Integrate and investigate entity "Mountain Troopers".
  Network-level Command; Enhance cohesion with frequent interactors, conceal network connections.
  Public-level Command; Maintain alias while operating task.
  Performance Notes; Good work so far, T. Looking forward to this one. Be faster. PS. That Marilynn woman you're rolling with was a Riphound. Might be useful.
  - L."
