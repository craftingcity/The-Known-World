### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were rich in both coin and avenues of action; after selling your captive from the [[Abyss]] to the Black Mage, [[Qiell Tilemundon]], you were handsomely rewarded with a large sum of coinage, some magical equipment, and a visit from the secret upper echelons of [[Cenva Minyo]], who have taken interest in - at the very least - watching you, for now. 

After both meetings with the Winter Elf known as Paulo Equestria, you have assessed that these secret actors may be willing to support you, should you prove useful to them.
