### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they were rich in both coin and avenues of action; after selling [[Kalariel]], your captive from the [[Abyss]], to the Black Mage, [[Qiell Tilemundon]], you were handsomely rewarded with a large sum of coinage, some magical equipment, and a visit from the secret upper echelons of [[Cenva Minyo]], who have taken interest in - at the very least - watching you, for now. 

After both of your meetings with the Winter Elf known as Paulo Equestria, you have assessed that these secret actors may have similar if not entirely aligned goals. With this in mind, I must ask you; if you chose to do so, how do you travel to the [[Actstow Hills]]?

### What does the World Know?
From [[Coalition City]], a cart-ride with an independent merchant will take four adventurers to [[Yahlin]] / [[Onehana]] in three days for 25-40 silver. A boat-ride is more expensive and will take longer. Walking is the most economical option, but would take no less than four days.
