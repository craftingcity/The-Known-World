### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they committed murder in [[Moonlight]], were taken to and had broken out of jail, robbed a Guild of Merchants' caravan, and escaped into the night, leaving Cedric and his morals to explain the situation in the morning. 

You four have begun your journey as genuine adventurers; you have money, you've committed crimes, and you have a kind of mystery to solve. There are places to go, things to take, and people to kill. If you have an interest, you have a manner of pursuing it.

What do you do?

### What happened?


They met a man named Nikolai, and did drugs on the side of the road with him, so he's rolling with us for a while.

They made their way into Coalition City, were they plan to falsify the delivery they were hired for, maybe to blame the driver for the misdelivery. In addition, Zipper is looking for a Firearms shop, Roan is looking for other Slimknife/SEASec contacts (for missions? for information?), Saoirse is hunting for information about her experience with the 'Not a Deer', Nikolai is looking to scout the Guild of Wizards Center of Arcane Education, and Wren is still mostly around for the ride... i think.

### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had completed their journey at haste, having travelled from the city of [[Gambleum]] to their destination in [[Coalition City]] in just over two days. Having investigated the contents of your caravan, you decided to keep the mysterious, glowing blue, baby-foot-like stone, you elected to supplement your delivery with the contents of another caravan. You know where the cart is supposed to be when you finish your delivery, but you know to that you are here much earlier than you were scheduled to be - the documents you took from the corpse of your driver, John, indicate that you're over 30 hours early.

You have caused damage in your wake, and for as much as you swear otherwise, you will one day face the consequences of your actions. For now, though, you have time. Time to shop, time to talk, time to learn. Time to get a new job? This is the grandest city in the world, or so they say, so...

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

##### The Delivery
The [[Northstone Family Trading Company]] has a depot in the [[Wheel Ward]] of [[Coalition City]], where they expect a number of carts, but the one our party delivers is notably suspect, - missing a manifest and a driver, and carrying goods that are explicitly not ours to transport - something has gone wrong. Divinatory investigation would reveal that it was our party and not an outside influence that borked this job.

##### The Arms Dealer
[[Golden Ward#The Arms Dealer]]

##### The Slimknives
[[Ruby Ward#The Obra Dinn]]

##### The Library
[[Jade Ward#The Center of Arcane Education]]
	- In the search of the creature from Saoirse's encounter, they'll find information about demons, devils, the *fey*, and more recently, the Undead. (the fey is perfect, its like the reverse of the call home??) (black blood might connect everyone better though, maybe even kalquiell)
	- To be more intriguing, they might find a book that talks about divination identification for dreams and fears - 'but its only a theory'...

### What happened?

Saoirse & Niko went to the restricted section on the 3rd floor of the Library, Wren is looking for more info on who and what they are, 22 is chillin with Wren, Roan went to [[Ruby Ward#The Obra Dinn]].


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
