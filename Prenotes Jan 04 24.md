### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were on the hunt for power. They had killed a witch of some disgusting necrotic abilities and gathered a sack of arcane ingredients. Since then, they have traveled north into the [[Firelight Sea]] in search of a kind old dragon by the name of [[Kakurak]].

Without an address for your quarry's lair, I put the question to you, what is your path ahead?

### What does the World Know?

### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the date of 17th of Weeding 105 AF, as they are resting in [[Kakurak's Lair]], discussing their plans to travel to [[Kailkeep]] and gather more power there.
