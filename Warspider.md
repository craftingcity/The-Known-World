The Warspider is a type of interplanar war machine. It is a gargantuan metal construction, taking up 35 square feet and standing at over 45 feet tall. It has long legs that take up over half of its height, roughly 25 feet. The central chamber is 21 feet tall and 24 feet wide. It holds the mechanics of the Warspider, such as its core and controls and its pilot, and it is built on commission for [[King Snure]]. Along the outside, elemental weaponry is attatched, and can be fired from inside the Beast (the ).

It is powered by a core of elemental Fire from the [[The Planes of Existence#The Plane of Fire|plane thereof]].
