### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were deep in the center of the mountain known as [[Kailkeep]] that holds the Hells for which the residents use as a sick form of entertainment. After quickly defeating a squad of desperate Golden Claws, the party began to explore, and found that the walls were marked with remarks ranging from helpful to misleading to deranged. They had many paths they could begin to follow, and chose to enter a chamber indicated to be a hound's den - where they met a trio of survivors barely escaping a rolling boulder!

We return to the party only moments after we had left them, in this chamber with two new companions, and one path forward. Many more, if one would care to back-track so early into their exploration, but I must put the question to you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

It is the night of the 17th, and they have been in here for a number of hours at this point. The three were a part of a group of travelers crossing the desert from [[Kickoff]] to [[Ahaustin]], and were captured along with three others. The rest did not survive the encounter. It has been maybe a day and a half, and none of the three have slept - they are just barely more adapted to the harsh conditions of [[Kailkeep]]'s Hells.
