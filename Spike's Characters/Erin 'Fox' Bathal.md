# Erin Bathal
## a.k.a 'Fox'

### Born and Raised
From all that I can remember, my Mother and I lived alone. She could not support me, and while the war was still coming, she sent me off to become something worthwhile. 

I learned how to fight, not just with swords and spears (though the glaive combines my favorite aspects of the two), but with my mind also - though in truth much of it has not stuck with me.

And then a man came to the school; called himself a Hawkford and promised me exactly what I desired.

### Time with the Hawkfords
For a few years, I made myself a useful soldier. I think that the family had something against me; they never really wanted me on the inside, if you know what I mean. 

I ran quite a few Operations with my teams before the rumor of war came to me, and I was already too deep to say no to what was very obviously a trap. I am one of the few of us who survived - and nowadays only Boar (brute?) and Sparrow (archer). It was Hawkford money. I moved on; had to. 

We've been working odd jobs together for a while now, my last few House buddies and I. That message rings true in my mind still; about how I was...

###### The River Barges
Three raft-esq boats each carry one third of the expedition; the Science team, Cargo team, and Mercenary team. We're looking for the remains of an ancient civilization in the Kishmala Rainforest. The Green-Barrow company was our parent patron.

	Garran is our CO for this mission - wields a greatsword.
	Rowenna Green is a halfling scientist, VIP, primary escort objective.
	Looks like some large beast-man is in charge on the cargo ships.

While travelling, we notice a triplet of river-beasts leaving the river about 60ft upriver after (MAYBE) eating a person? (Spencer found an ancient symbol of Teok in the water) We travelled a while longer before stopping to make camp for our first expedition area.

As we've travelled into the Jungle, we notice a group of human people with handcrafted bone garments, crude wooden bows and spears. Bout 10 minutes later, we find a half-wall and three house buildings.

	1. Currently unoccupied, abandondoned for a while. Stairs lead down on the backside of the house. Next to a wooden chest, banded and locked in Iron. Downstairs is a stone room, cracked, completely empty other than 3 skeletons.
	2. Similarly unoccupied and abandoned. Found another ancient symbol of Teok in the Kitchen. 
	3. Apparently a recent struggle occured here - furnishing makes evidence for a scuffle between a few folks. Downstairs, there are a bunch of skeletons about the floor, one has a rusted shortsword.

The skeletons awoke, we fended them off, and are resting in the 3rd house.
