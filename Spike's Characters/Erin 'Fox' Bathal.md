# Erin Bathal
## a.k.a 'Fox'

### Born and Raised
From all that I can remember, my Mother and I lived alone. She could not support me, and while the war was still coming, she sent me off to become something worthwhile. 

I learned how to fight, not just with swords and spears (though the glaive combines my favorite aspects of the two), but with my mind also - though in truth much of it has not stuck with me.

And then a man came to the school; called himself a Hawkford and promised me exactly what I desired.

### Time with the Hawkfords
For a few years, I made myself a useful soldier. I exchanged blood for money. I think that the family had something against that; they never really wanted me on the inside, if you know what I mean. 

I ran quite a few Operations with my teams before the rumor of war came to me, and I was already too deep to say no to what was very obviously a suicide run. I am one of the few of us who survived - and nowadays only Boar and Sparrow are with me. It was good money, but I moved on; I had to. 

Money's shit now. Odd jobs don't pay well.

### Living "Beyond my Time"
##### Session One; 06/27/23
## The Party
Arie - dark wizard
Lavinia Moss - elven ranger
Spencer Forescythe - simplistic human monastic
Laelithar - fire elf druid/ranger
Wilferd M. - purple kobold with weird eyes & trident
Barthalamule - ice-white-blue lizard man

###### The River Barges
Three raft-esq boats each carry one third of the expedition; the Science team, Cargo team, and Mercenary team. We're looking for the remains of an ancient civilization in the **Kishmala Rainforest**. The **Green-Barrow Company** was our parent patron.

	Garran is our CO for this mission - wields a greatsword.
	Rowenna Green is a halfling scientist, VIP, primary escort objective.
	Looks like some large beast-man is in charge on the cargo ships.

While travelling, we notice a triplet of river-beasts leaving the river about 60ft upriver after (MAYBE) eating a person? (Spencer found an ancient symbol of Teok in the water) We travelled a while longer before stopping to make camp for our first expedition area.

As we've travelled into the Jungle, we notice a group of human people with handcrafted bone garments, crude wooden bows and spears. Bout 10 minutes later, we find a half-wall and three house buildings.

	1. Currently unoccupied, abandondoned for a while. Stairs lead down on the backside of the house. Next to a wooden chest, banded and locked in Iron. Downstairs is a stone room, cracked, completely empty other than 3 skeletons.
	2. Similarly unoccupied and abandoned. Found another ancient symbol of Teok in the Kitchen. 
	3. Apparently a recent struggle occured here - furnishing makes evidence for a scuffle between a few folks. Downstairs, there are a bunch of skeletons about the floor, one has a rusted shortsword.

The skeletons awoke, we fended them off, and are resting in the 3rd house.

##### Session Two; 07/25/23
###### The Inner Jungle

The wall, as described, is connected to an over grown road. It ends/begins at the houses, and continues into the jungle. We continue to travel along the road and find a pair of houses wrecked. Laelithar shapes into a mouse and explores, reporting that the insides of the rubble are uninteresting and too dense to continue exploration. Lavinia reports that the road is magical, but cannot determine the school. 

We suddenly pass through an invisible barrier, which suddenly shifts the acre of jungle in front of us into a grass clearing; the road is now straight and very well-kept, leading towards a large stepped pyramid. The creatures of the jungle, even the bugs and birds, are not here in the clearing with us - this is disturbing.

I sent the entry team of Barthalamule, Arie, and Spencer to clear the first room before the rest of us enter. Entry team met contact (4x ghoul-esq) down the right corridor, and used Thunderwave to alert the rest of the party.

Laelithar and Liviana were marking the perimeter of the clearing/illusion during this time.

##### Session Three; 08/29/23
###### In the Pyramid

We investigate the corpses, and Arey tells us that they are "wild" or "natural" undead. We continue into a large rectangular room (55'x30') with a small table in the corner. The table has a stone tablet with inscription on it in and one-quarter of a metal house-crest - Aery takes the crest, Rowenna the tablet.

In a second room there are two small containers on a table and a trunk underneath. The first container has a magical tattoo needle and a vial of green ink and the second has two large mushrooms (*Giant's Bane*), a small dark alchemical vial of cobra venom, and two salamander claws. In the trunk, another quarter of this crest - again.
