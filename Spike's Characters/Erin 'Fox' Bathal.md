### Born and Raised
From all that I can remember, my Mother and I lived alone. She could not support me, and while the war was still coming, she sent me off to become something worthwhile. 

I learned how to fight, not just with swords and spears (though the glaive combines my favorite aspects of the two), but with my mind also - though in truth much of it has not stuck with me.

And then a man came to the school; called himself a Hawkford and promised me exactly what I desired.
