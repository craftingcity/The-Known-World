### Born and Raised
From all that I can remember, my Mother and I lived alone. She could not support me, and while the war was still coming, she sent me off to become something worthwhile. 

I learned how to fight, not just with swords and spears (though the glaive combines my favorite aspects of the two), but with my mind also - though in truth much of it has not stuck with me.

And then a man came to the school; called himself a Hawkford and promised me exactly what I desired.

### Time with the Hawkfords
For a few years, I made myself a useful soldier. I exchanged blood for money. I think that the family had something against that; they never really wanted me on the inside, if you know what I mean. 

I ran quite a few Operations with my teams before the rumor of war came to me, and I was already too deep to say no to what was very obviously a suicide run. I am one of the few of us who survived - and nowadays only Boar and Sparrow are with me. It was good money, but I moved on; I had to. 

Money's shit now. Odd jobs don't pay well.

### Living "Beyond my Time"
##### Session One; 06/27/23
## The Party
Arie - Aaracokra Necromancer
Lavinia Moss - Wood Elf Ranger
Spencer Forescythe - Human Pugilist
Laelithar - Fire Elf Ranger Druid
Wilferd M. - Mystic Purple Kobold, Caster Extrordinaer
Barthalamule - Winter Lizardfolk Paladin of Glory

###### The River Barges
Three raft-esq boats each carry one third of the expedition; the Science team, Cargo team, and Mercenary team. We're looking for the remains of an ancient civilization in the **Kishmala Rainforest**. The **Green-Barrow Company** was our parent patron.

	Garran is our CO for this mission - wields a greatsword.
	Rowenna Green is a halfling scientist, VIP, primary escort objective.
	Looks like some large beast-man is in charge on the cargo ships.

While travelling, we notice a triplet of river-beasts leaving the river about 60ft upriver after (MAYBE) eating a person? (Spencer found an ancient symbol of Teok in the water) We travelled a while longer before stopping to make camp for our first expedition area.

As we've travelled into the Jungle, we notice a group of human people with handcrafted bone garments, crude wooden bows and spears. Bout 10 minutes later, we find a half-wall and three house buildings.

	1. Currently unoccupied, abandondoned for a while. Stairs lead down on the backside of the house. Next to a wooden chest, banded and locked in Iron. Downstairs is a stone room, cracked, completely empty other than 3 skeletons.
	2. Similarly unoccupied and abandoned. Found another ancient symbol of Teok in the Kitchen. 
	3. Apparently a recent struggle occured here - furnishing makes evidence for a scuffle between a few folks. Downstairs, there are a bunch of skeletons about the floor, one has a rusted shortsword.

The skeletons awoke, we fended them off, and are resting in the 3rd house.

##### Session Two; 07/25/23
###### The Inner Jungle

The wall, as described, is connected to an over grown road. It ends/begins at the houses, and continues into the jungle. We continue to travel along the road and find a pair of houses wrecked. Laelithar shapes into a mouse and explores, reporting that the insides of the rubble are uninteresting and too dense to continue exploration. Lavinia reports that the road is magical, but cannot determine the school. 

We suddenly pass through an invisible barrier, which suddenly shifts the acre of jungle in front of us into a grass clearing; the road is now straight and very well-kept, leading towards a large stepped pyramid. The creatures of the jungle, even the bugs and birds, are not here in the clearing with us - this is disturbing.

I sent the entry team of Barthalamule, Arie, and Spencer to clear the first room before the rest of us enter. Entry team met contact (4x ghoul-esq) down the right corridor, and used Thunderwave to alert the rest of the party.

Laelithar and Liviana were marking the perimeter of the clearing/illusion during this time.

##### Session Three; 08/29/23
###### In the Pyramid, I

We investigate the corpses, and Arey tells us that they are "wild" or "natural" undead. We continue into a large rectangular room (55'x30') with a small table in the corner. The table has a stone tablet with inscription on it in and one-quarter of a metal house-crest - Aery takes the crest, Rowenna the tablet.

In a second room there are two small containers on a table and a trunk underneath. The first container has a magical tattoo needle and a vial of green ink and the second has two large mushrooms (*Giant's Bane*), a small dark alchemical vial of cobra venom, and two *salamander* claws. In the trunk, another quarter of this crest - again. 

Continuing, we find a door in the hall to the north-western room on which there is an imprint of what we can assume is the complete crest that we have been building, and therefore we must find the third and fourth crest pieces before continuing this way. The hallway continues into another room. 

The third room had three ghouls and the third part of the crest.

##### Session Four; 09/26/23
###### In The Pyramid, II

We acquire the fourth crest piece and put them all together, but fail to recognize the heraldry. After taking a short rest, we place the crest in its slot, and the doors slowly rumble open. Before us, a large, completely flat room takes up the central space of the pyramid. The very tip is open to the sunlight above us.

As the party enters, the shadows contort into a large 10-foot tall humanoid figure clad in some kind of magical spectral armor and weapon. We fought it, Wilferd's radiant bolt did especially well, and after defeating it the floor rumbles and lowers - it's a platform! The ghoul-kin rush out above us, flooding the walls as we fall. At the bottom, I light a torch, and it becomes clear that we are in a cave - the very bottom of this pyramid.

##### Session Five; 10/10/23
###### In The Pyramid III

Looking around this cave-room, we see only one way forward, and decide to take it. As we continue through this cave area, we see some artwork that depicts a powerful radiant "main figure" and many smaller figures in submission and deference to it.

Rowena calls out that the writing on the tablet we got earlier and the writing on this artwork is the same language. As we continue, we see a measure of daylight, and we push and cut foliage out of the way to reveal the jungle before us. With Arae's help, we navigate our way back towards the river and our camp. 

###### Back at the Camp
Our camp is smoking, and we can smell burning flesh; Fox, Arae, Spencer, and Barth rush back into camp while the rest of the gang slows and sneaks to the edge of camp.

Boar and Sparrow are probably okay, none of their gear is on any of the corpses or around the camp. 

###### Leaving the Jungle I
The party is going to move on, heading back the way we came, back to the town we came from. We start immediately, and continue walking through the night. During our travel along the river, we are set upon by three giant dragonflies, and with minor damage, we defeated them.

##### Session Six; 11/7/23
###### Leaving the Jungle II
Four folks wearing the tribal wear and clubs that we saw before walked into our camp and refused to communicate with us. We killed them. We kept moving into town.

##### Session Seven; 11/14/23
###### The City in Keshmala
The guards give us a little bit of a hard time getting in, they seem weary of outsiders.

	- Keshmala Inn & Tavern
		- Saied:
			- "Not too many folks come around here that I don't know about ... haven't seen anyone going by those names or looking like you."
			- "Always have to worry about the Natives; they take captives ... they show up on our doorstep ... take what they want ... they want people who they think can show a good fight."
			- "One man, works the river more than anything ... Kailen, you can find him on the water in the morning."
	- Diarf's Smithy
	- Rita's General Goods
		- Nice lady, she's got a Travelling section.
	- Delonious' Emporium
		- This guy is strange.

Saied seemed to suggest that if Boar and Sparrow were captured by natives, they would be taken South into the Desert Cities - maybe even specifically *Nevos*.

In an attempt to gain enough money to charter a ship south along the coast towards the desert, we robbed Diarf for a "Godsteel Axe" that was supposedly worth 3500gp.
