### Born and Raised
From all that I can remember, my Mother and I lived alone. She could not support me, and while the war was still coming, she sent me off to become something worthwhile. 

I learned how to fight, not just with swords and spears (though the glaive combines my favorite aspects of the two), but with my mind also - though in truth much of it has not stuck with me.

And then a man came to the school; called himself a Hawkford and promised me exactly what I desired.

### Time with the Hawkfords
For a few years, I made myself a useful soldier. I think that the family had something against me; they never really wanted me on the inside, if you know what I mean. 

I ran quite a few Operations with my teams before the rumor of war came to me, and I was already too deep to say no to what was very obviously a trap. I am one of the few of us who survived. It was Hawkford money. I moved on; had to. 

We've been working odd jobs together for a while now, my last few House buddies and I. That message rings true in my mind still; about how I was...

### Living "Beyond my Time"
##### Session One; 02/27/23
## The Party
Arie - dark wizard
Livinia Moss - elven ranger
Spencer Forescythe - simplistic human monastic
Laelithar - fire elf druid/ranger
Wilferd M. - purple kobold with weird eyes & trident

###### The River Barges
Three raft-esq boats each carry one third of the expedition; the Science team, Cargo team, and Mercenary team. We're looking for the remains of an ancient civilization in the Kishmala Rainforest. 

Garran is our CO for this mission - wields a greatsword.
Rowenna Green is a halfling scientist, VIP, primary escort objective.
Looks like some large beast-man is in charge on the cargo ships.

While travelling, we notice a triplet of river-beasts leaving the river about 60ft upriver.
