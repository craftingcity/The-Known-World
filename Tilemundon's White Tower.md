# The Black Mages Tower
## Qiell's Goals
1. Above all else, protect my secrets here. I have more secrets than I can honestly remember, and I would burn my home to keep them.
2. If it is necessary, my Tower should act as a means of escape from my worries and any threats - if not to start somewhere new, then indefinitely, then for a year or more.
3. I wish to unlock the secrets of immortality.

###### To Whom It May Concern
> To whom it may concern...
> You have entered my bedchambers, and thus I must assume you know of me and my identity, so I will do myself the honor of not introducing myself by my name.
> I have spent fourty two years of my frail human life. To some, fourty is a gift. To others, it is the age of a young child, still yet to see the world's secrets. To others still, time has little meaning, and they would retort they have been, and will be.
> It is my life's goal to see that I am no longer frail. That I will be. That I have been and will be.
> I need only for the time to be right. That my true master would set me free from my chains in my mortal form. Please, excuse yourself, and keep what you have seen here to yourself. Do not open any other letters. I will know.

###### Chicago Bulls
> To the Chicago Bulls...
> I have my doubts that this letter will ever find you - any of you, individually or as collective. I must say, I am indebted to you, there is no amount of currency or valuable gem I could conquer for you that would make me feel otherwise. I am no longer held in chains by my life because of the actions that you chose to take.
> Thank you. 
###### Alergra
> To Alergra...
> You have always been a great teacher and a brilliant mind. I do not wish you harm, but I know that you are a righteous woman and you will think that what I have done is abhorrent. You will try to stop me, or destroy me, or even contain and examine me. I can not let you. Do not make me hurt you.
###### Nicolas
> To Nicolas
###### Pirre
> To Pirre
###### Blue
> To Blue...
> Eat rocks.
