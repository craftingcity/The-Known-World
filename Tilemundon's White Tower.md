# The Black Mages Tower
## Qiell's Goals
1. Above all else, protect my secrets here. I have more secrets than I can honestly remember, and I would burn my home to keep them.
2. If it is necessary, my Tower should act as a means of escape from my worries and any threats - if not to start somewhere new, then indefinitely, then for a year or more.
3. I wish to unlock the secrets of immortality.
