# The Black Mages Tower
## Qiell's Goals
1. Above all else, protect my secrets here. I have more secrets than I can honestly remember, and I would burn my home to keep them.
2. If it is necessary, my Tower should act as a means of escape from my worries and any threats - if not to start somewhere new, then indefinitely, then for a year or more.
3. I wish to unlock the secrets of immortality.

###### To Whom It May Concern
> To whom it may concern...
> You have entered my bedchambers, and thus I must assume you know of me and my identity, so I will do myself the honor of not introducing myself by my name.
> I have spent fourty two years of my frail human life. To some, fourty is a gift. To others, it is the age of a young child, still yet to see the world's secrets. To others still, time has little meaning, and they would retort they have been, and will be.
> It is my life's goal to see that I am no longer frail. That I will be. That I have been and will be.
> I need only for the time to be right. That my true master would set me free from my chains in my mortal form. Please, excuse yourself, and keep what you have seen here to yourself. Do not open any other letters. I will know.

###### Chicago Bulls
> To the Chicago Bulls...
> I have my doubts that this letter will ever find you - any of you, individually or as collective. I must say, I am indebted to you, there is no amount of currency or valuable gem I could conquer for you that would make me feel otherwise. I am no longer held in chains by my life because of the actions that you chose to take.
> Thank you. 

###### Alergra
> To Alergra...
> I expect you to be the one to come here and find these notes. I do not know how long I will stay in my tower, but if anyone would find me, you would.
> You have always been a great teacher and a brilliant mind. I do not wish you harm, but I know that you are a righteous woman, and you will think that what I have done is abhorrent. You will try to stop me, or destroy me, or even contain and examine me. I can not let you. Do not make me hurt you.

###### Nicolas
> To Nicolas...
> I do not envy you. I know you are a liar, and you know more than you say you do. I think you are closer to the Flame than you should be and you will not tell Pirre because you know she would have you cast out.
> If you would ignore her, find me. I could use your insight.

###### Pirre
> To Pirre...
> I hate you. You are wrong. Danger is where we find the most about ourselves and our limitations. Of anyone among us, I would have expected you to understand. Do not hurt yourself trying to stop me. There are more important persuits; hold the council together, fight the demon in the Combine, defeat the fascism in the West. Do not look for me, or I will smite you where you stand.

###### Blue
> To Blue...
> Eat rocks, you pig.

### Immortality Machine
- A set of machinery reminiscent of Kalariel's machine in his Tower on [[Thanatos]].
- Currently containing Kalariel's body, decrepit and rotting in the green black goop that Qiell has created using his research. Qiell has embued a large saphirre on the machine that holds a connection for his Faith and Soul.
- When Qiell dies, he will enter Kalariel's body, and together they will become Kial, the First Lich.
