### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were trapped in time and crystal - amber, to be specific. On your way to transport this massive slab, you simply touched it, and have been forced to fight in this disorienting space for the dragon claws being held by this place's guardians. Having survived them, you collected five of their items in a raised depository. For a moment, there was no change, but slowly the walls began to slow their shifting, and you began to hear a great scraping - something has opened, presenting an exit, further danger, or both.

### What does the World Know?

We get to fight Tymirek! He wants to leave, but he's an asshole (and has nothing to give), so he might have to scrap to get out of here. We can try to talk to them if they don't just attack us right away. He is (roughly) a [Young Gold Dragon](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=young-gold-dragon).

He will try to escape before really trying to button down and kill the party, he wants to get out of here and maybe make his way to [[Kailkeep]], where he could either base for a while or simply 'do a run' before setting up somewhere else. 

Kailkeep isn't so far and we'd be sighted by [[Dampguard]] (and other Baronies in the area), the Thieves, and the [[Golden Claws]] - and seeing another dragon come around is not good! We like to not have those hanging around!

We haven't really seen any around since like, the 60s excepting Tetrimoc, so something's going on? (they're just moving in from the Wildlands a little more commonly in this generation so they dont have to move into the other planes)

We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
