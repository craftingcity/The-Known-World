### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had recovered from their inter-planar travel from a small section of the [[Abyss]] back into their homeland. They traveled from the southern beaches of the [[Alvalini River]] northwest into the city of [[New Quillbuck]], where they met with [[Baron Harvord]] and spent the night. 

Harvord shared information regarding another Baron, [[Baron Avory]], who supposedly has a major interest in Daelith, as well as requesting that you "deal" with a group of [[Beasts Righteous]] occupying an outpost nearby.

Upon your decline, the [[Baron Harvord]] simply dismissed you to your personal businesses. As you travel quickly away from the disturbing settlement, with the morning sun cresting into the sky, I put the question to you, what do you do?
