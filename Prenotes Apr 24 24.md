### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had made progress deeper into Minyostalma. Having left the relative safety of the Rookie Village, you all set your sights towards following the path your quarry has left behind. In your travel, you passed into the Factory Showroom and noticed the carnage of a quiet battlefield within this place. Speaking out and revealing that your intentions were in fact peaceful seems to have been a good decision, as you now travel with the residents of this Factory towards a secret path that will land you within the Base, closer still to finding Romeo, in whatever state he might be in.

We return to the party in a moment of tension. Guns are raised, enemies identified. You and your guides have the advantage - the White Flame Military Scavengers have yet to see you, though they are clearly expecting resistance.

As you feel yourself breathing, being as quiet and small against the walls as you can, you see "Bubbles" ready her grenade. "Dom" begins a five-count on his hands for you all to see. 5. 4. Bubbles throws the grenade. 3. The men around the machinery have noticed, but yet to act. 2. They scream. 1. An explosion occurs, and combat begins.

Surveyed about challange level, the allies they have rn made it too easy - less allies, stronger enemies, and hopefully fewer enemies too, its a lot yknow

higher attack bonus and damage would be fix, ac & health felt ok for numbers we had

We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
