### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were in the city of [[Ootool]], having removed the Whitimores from their previous holding. During this escape, the collective of drow left behind a number of important items. A contract decreeing an Alliance between the Matron of the House Whitimore and King Snure, a name you have heard before from the [[Jarl Grungar]] as the Giant he answers to on this planar assault. A diary, describing bits and pieces of the truth of the Whitimore's plans, something about pieces... And finally, and perhaps most perplexingly, an enchanted black chain, similar to one you found in the treasury of the Hill Giants and returned to [[Kakurak]] for greater inspection.

With full bellies, an ally at your side, and the fate of the world you call home in your hands, I ***bequeath*** you! What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
[[Jarl Grungar]] agreed to resend involvement 

### What happened?
