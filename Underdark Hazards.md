### Underdark Hazards

Explorers routinely encounter common dungeon hazards such as yellow mold or green slime in the Underdark. In addition, the Realms Below are home to a variety of unique perils and diseases that have laid low more than one heroic adventurer.

#### Underdark Slimes, Molds, Fungi, and Lichen

No place in Toril, or perhaps even the multiverse, boasts a greater variety and quantity of fungi than the Underdark. Much of it is innocuous, and some is even cultivated for food (see Plants and Fungi, above), but some of it is exceedingly dangerous.

**Fool's Water (CR 3)**: This slime looks like a small spring of water, but a DC 20 Knowledge (dungeoneering or nature) check can reveal its true nature upon sight. Any creature that touches fool's water takes 1d6 points of acid damage. Thereafter, the substance clings to the victim like slime, dealing the same amount of acid damage each round for the next 2d6 rounds. On the first round of contact, it can be scraped off easily, but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away. (All these processes apply damage to the victim as well.) Against wood or metal, fool's water deals 1d6 points of acid damage but has no continuing effect.

Fool's water is extremely reactive with regular water. Trying to wash the slime off with water causes an explosion that deals 3d6 points of acid damage to every creature within 10 feet.

Extreme cold or heat, sunlight, or a _cure disease_ spell destroys a patch of fool's water.

**Cave Creeper (CR 1)**: Cave creeper is a gray-and-white fungus that flourishes near water. It is especially common in the Lowerdark where it grows close to most of the water sources. Cave creeper continually emits spores that cause cave terrors. Every creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or suffer the effect of a _confusion_ spell. Another DC 15 Fortitude save is required 1 minute later - even by those who succeeded on the first save - to avoid taking 2d4 points of Intelligence damage. Sunlight or acid instantly destroys cave creeper.

**Fire Fungus (CR 4)**: This fungal growth sheds a much-appreciated warmth, raising the temperature within 30 feet of it by 10 degrees. However, any open flame brought within 40 feet of fire fungus causes it to explode, dealing 5d6 points of fire damage to each creature in a 20-foot radius. Such an explosion kills the fire fungus, and it can also be killed by cold damage - 10 points of cold damage is sufficient to kill a 1-foot-square patch.

Some Underdark races use fire fungus for warmth instead of fires, since kindling and firewood are scarce in the Realms Below. Grimlocks and gloamings especially favor it.

**Wisp Lichen (CR 4)**: This white lichen clings to the ceilings of high caverns and poses a threat primarily to flying creatures. Its sticky strands can paralyze a creature that touches them (Fort DC 11) and hold smaller creatures (up to 100 pounds) that it has already paralyzed for eventual, slow consumption (1 point of Constitution drain per hour). Larger paralyzed creatures fall if they had been flying by natural means. Because of this phenomenon, earth-bound predators usually lurk near patches of wisp lichen, waiting for the crash or thud that indicates a tasty morsel of paralyzed prey has fallen to earth.

#### Diseases

The Underdark environment also poses a considerable threat in terms of disease. All the diseases described in the Dungeon Master's Guide exist in the Underdark, but a few diseases are unique to this realm.

**Lungrot**: This disease most often strikes air-breathing creatures that have been sealed inside ancient ruins.

**Scaleflake**: This disease most often strikes aquatic or reptilian creatures, but anyone swimming, wading, or submerged in tainted water can contract it. Scaleflake manifests as swelling, oozing, smelly pustules coating the surface of the afflicted creature's body.

**Softpox**: This disease makes the skin soft, swollen, and tender. This effect reduces the victim's natural armor bonus (if greater than +0) by 1 point per day. Once the creature's natural armor bonus reaches +0 (whether by reduction or because the creature had no natural armor bonus in the first place), the disease deals 10 hit points of damage each day.

Disease | Infection Style | DC | Incubation Period | Daily Damage
--- | ---
Lungrot | Inhaled | 20 | 1d4 hours | 1d4 Con, 1d6 / 2 Str*
Scaleflake | Contact 15 1d6 / 2 days | 1d4 Cha
Softpox | Contact 28 | 1 day | -1 to natural armor bonus (or if +0, 10 hp damage)

*Successful saves do not allow the character to recover. Only magical healing can save the character.
