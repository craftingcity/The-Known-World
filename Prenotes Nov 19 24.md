### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were staying in the manor of [[Bandeer]]'s Duche, [[Hedwig a'Alden]]. After satisfying him with your participation in his previous request, he asked you to take an expedition to [[The Old|Minyostalma]]. After learning of the dangers present there, you all chose to pursue other opportunities. Your hesitations, reservations, and eventual denial of the request left Eve confused and scorned. This is the job. She's going. She gathered the equipment, gifted you a final look of disgust, and took off.

What do you do?
