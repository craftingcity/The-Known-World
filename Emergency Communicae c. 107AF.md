## CONTENT

SPEAKER: ... [unintelligible] ... Very well. Lets begin. The day is the 24th of Final Planting. I am [[Speaker Vanavar]]. Please present your case.

ADV.: I am [[Filip Grundle]], I speak on behalf of [[Yyu Clipwin]] as a representative of the [[Guild of Adventurers]]. Through reputable means - the [[Kakurak|adventurer dragon]], Kakurak - we have been alerted to a force of Giantfolk marching into the territories of [[The Church of the White Flame]].

CWF: Yes; as Grundle speaks the truth. The domains of the Tendered [[Valerio Avishalom|Avishalom]], [[|Avner]], and [[|Haleli]], as well as their subordinates, have received harsh attacks against them.
