The Louisville Infection will progress into Stage 1 Infection within 48 hours of initial contact to the Infection Source. Without immediate separation of contaminated and non-contaminated cells, the Infection is fatal in 100% of documented cases.

After Stage 4, a Louisville Infection Host (L.I.H.) will reanimate without the use of it's now ineffective internal structure and begin to wander their local area in search of sources of noise or smell.

Minimal testing suggests that a L.I.H has a significant advantage in these two fields compared to an average reasearcher, and becomes vocally and visually enranged when they detect the presence of non-L.I.H entities via these senses.
