### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had united with newfound and refound allies on their journey to the space beyond Alaturmen. In seeking answers from the Council of Mages regarding the "black blood curse", the party was directed to a mysterious place that they now reside within - this space is dark, the air here is dry and harsh in your throats, and you are - seemingly - without direction in this space.
