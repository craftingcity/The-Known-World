In an effort to organize my thoughts on the state of the campaign, I am creating an unordered list of thoughts. Fundamentally, I am dissatisfied by the current state.

- *Tactics*
	- So far, each of the different hostiles we have encountered are utilizing the same 'second wave' style deployment strategy. There is always a second group - of roughly a third or a half the size of the first - that will arrive as the first group begins to take casualties.
	- So far, each of the different hostiles we have encountered are utilizing some form of debilitating crowd control, some way of holding someone where they are or taking their turn entirely. I understand that it presents a sincere element of danger, but while it does so, it removes choices from individual players and the party as a whole. Actually damaging someone leaves room for them to make choices while they are still conscious, while presenting at least the same level of danger if not more. 
	- So far, each of the different hostiles we have encountered are acting *oddly*. What I mean by this is; the wild animals are holding space against our frontline fighters, or fully commit to fights instead of slash-and-grabbing one of us to eat, while the tool-wielding near-human-intelligence faction fighters are engaging us seemingly territorially and without advantage - though we haven't made contact with enough for my taste or to form an opinion on your use of them.
- *Choices / Saying No*
	- In my opinion, while we are DMing, our default respone should be "Yes, but..."
