### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had returned to the [[Deakred Range]] to investigate the company that had hired them, [[Web Spun Solutions]], and the effects of the quarantine declared in the surrounding Mining Colonies - which has seemingly spread since your last visit.

Upon their investigation of the 4th Mining Colony, they found a trio of stationed guards wielding durandurm carbine blasters who where wholly unprepared to communicate with or assist you. They quickly retreated to the top of the supply center as they fired upon you, screaming into their Sending Stones that they need backup, that they've encountered an unknown threat; you.

We return to the party as they push forward, deeper into Colony 4, sprinting away into the 14th Plot to pursue further investigation. With the echoes of your footsteps behind you, you run through the tunnel and into the main cavern of Plot 14, finding a sight very familiar - much of this space is filled with boxes and carts filled with rocks and gravel. You see the bore-pit, the drill, and the descent cabling some 50' in front of you, and a small barracks and tool shed are tucked off to your right.

What do you do?
