## Kingdom of Prosper
### Prelim
The Kingdom of Prosper controls what was the [[Bandit Lords]]' territory, which is majorly farmland, and otherwise fairly forested. While it is not itself rich in resources, its relationship with the Dwarves of Acstow allows for them to be rich in metals and other precious materials. Magic does not impact the everyday life of a citizen of Prosper. The Kingdom is a slightly-less-than temperate region.

### Bread
Rye is the common bread, White Bread is a delicacy reserved for special occasions and other uses for white flour are unable to be substituted.

### Food
Rye is King, which makes Beer Queen. Apple drinks are good, but more expensive than Beer because of their use as a sugar alternative. The forests of Prosper are populated by plump deer and pig. Cattle are kept on large ranches in cities and villages, but herding and keeping cattle farther from civilization quickly becomes impossible, leading these people to use goats instead; Both cow and goat are common milks and cheeses. Rabbits are also bred on these "outskirts" and in larger operations in villages for their pelts and meat.

Most people would have no issue when presented with game, goat or fish, but pork and beef are highly desirable. As is Citrus, as it does not grow very well in this region.

Carrot, Bean, Potatoes, Cabbages are cheap alternatives for more expensive vegetables, like the imported eggplant and or proteins like meat.

Cinnamon is a highly imported spice, common even among the lower middle class.

### Land
Land is "owned" by the King, but he grants management to his nobles, who rent their land. The nobles are responsible for the upkeep of public works on their managed land, and the King often holds Common Court by lottery at festivals to check in with his citizenry.

Lands closer to Castle Prosper or Coalition City are considered much more valuable, as they are better protected. The best of the King's fields grow Barley.

### Overhead
In outskirt homesteads and villages, there are no ways of refridgerating food, but in larger villages and cities, iceboxes are maintained by journeymen mages. Most folk carry a self-defense weapon, and most family have at least one bow and set of arrows for hunting. Horses are the most common working animal in this region, although some folks hire bugbear instead of keeping a work animal. Often, farms have dairy working sheds and outbuildings for fuel storage.

### Cutting Corners
Rye is a cheap grain, and many vegetables are cheap as well. Game and "poor" meat is normalized, and quality livestock is considered a mild delicacy.

This means that soups, stews, and similar meals are common food, and when paired with local forage can prove to be quite tasteful. Not only is this considered culturally acceptable, it is considered an intelligent and practical choice.

### Middlemen
Prosper is positioned in the second best position for trade, lagging only slightly behind the prime real estate that is Coalition City, and it has established trade roads, meaning that cities have huge marketplaces of products from around Alaturmen. Often, a commoner will buy a small collection of novel spices for a season alongside their staples at festival markets.

### Craftsmen
The Guilds of Coalition City have their fingers in many pies, and are well represented in Prosper. While there are some non-members all over Alaturmen, the Guilds have good control over the prices of crafts in Prosper. Most goods and services can be found in cities, and some specialists can make enough work in the larger villages of the region. 

### Textiles
People in Prosper are mostly for furs and goat-wool. Cattle and Horse leather is more useful as other things. Canvas is more common than Linen, and much more common than the luxury import Silk.

### Preservation
There are few sources of salt in Prosper, although it is imported from both Combine and Acstow. Applesugar is fairly weak and distinctly flavored compared to other sources, but can still be used in preservatives. Cheese, Canned (with applesugar) and Pickled (generally in apple or barley vinegar) vegetables, Sausage, and Pemmican are the most common preservatives.

### Containers
Baskets and Bags are the most common transportation mediums, although barrels and boxes are still used in large operations. The pottery of the region is generally poor, and most folk import their pottery when they can.

### Mining
Prosper primarily trades with Acstow for their mining materials, although some specialties such as gems they buy from the south. While there are some operations in Prosper, with masters nearby, it's often better to import than produce.

### Magic
Prosper has access to most alchemical components, leading to a large alchemical industry in Prosper. The city of Magius holds an academy, and some of its most talented graduates work for the government as mages of war or as enchanters and artificers for their specialized needs.

### More
Prosper's people are generally well educated and hard working. While mercantilism is a common occupation, it is not a well respected one. The people of Prosper are typically not institutionally religious, they are community focused culturally. 


## Northeast Hobgoblin Territories
### Prelim
Much of the Territories are dense forest; grains are not as plentiful as meat and fruit, therefore Pemmican is the base food in these areas.

### Pemmican
By combining powdered meats and fruits with hot liquid fats and seasoning, a powerful and preservable food is made.

### Food
For selections of meat, there are many game animals to hunt and trap, and many families have small s
