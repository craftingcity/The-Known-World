## Kingdom of Prosper
### Prelim
The Kingdom of Prosper controls what was the [[Bandit Lords]]' territory, which is majorly farmland, and otherwise fairly forested.

Rye is the common bread, White Bread is a delicacy reserved for special occasions and other uses for white flour are unable to be substituted.

Rabbits are also bred on these "outskirts" and in larger operations in villages for their pelts and meat.
