## Kingdom of Prosper
### Prelim
The Kingdom of Prosper controls what was the [[Bandit Lords]]' territory, which is majorly farmland, and otherwise fairly forested. While it is not itself rich in resources, its relationship with the Dwarves of Acstow allows for them to be rich in metals and other precious materials. Magic does not impact the everyday life of a citizen of Prosper. The Kingdom is a slightly-less-than temperate region.

### Bread
Rye is the common bread, White Bread is a delicacy reserved for special occasions and other uses for white flour are unable to be substituted.

### Food
Rye is King, which makes Beer Queen. Apple drinks are good, but more expensive than Beer because of their use as a sugar alternative. The forests of Prosper are populated by plump deer and pig. Cattle are kept on large ranches in cities and villages, but herding and keeping cattle farther from civilization quickly becomes impossible, leading these people to use goats instead; Both cow and goat are common milks and cheeses. Rabbits are also bred on these "outskirts" and in larger operations in villages for their pelts and meat.

Most people would have no issue when presented with game, goat or fish, but pork and beef are highly desirable. As is Citrus, as it does not grow very well in this region.

Carrot, Bean, Potatoes, Cabbages are cheap alternatives for more expensive vegetables, like the imported eggplant and or proteins like meat.

Cinnamon is a highly imported spice, common even among the lower middle class.

### Land
Land is "owned" by the King, but he grants management to his nobles, who rent their land. The nobles are responsible for the upkeep of public works on their managed land, and the King often holds Common Court by lottery at festivals to check in with his citizenry.

Lands closer to Castle Prosper or Coalition City are considered much more valuable, as they are better protected. The best of the King's fields grow Barley.

### Overhead
In outskirt homesteads and villages, there are no ways of refridgerating food, but in larger villages and cities, iceboxes are maintained by journeymen mages. Most folk carry a self-defense weapon, and most family have at least one bow and set of arrows for hunting. Horses are the most common working animal in this region, although some folks hire bugbear instead of keeping a work animal.
