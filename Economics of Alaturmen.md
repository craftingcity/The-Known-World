## Kingdom of Prosper
### Prelim


### Bread


### Food
Rye is King, which makes Beer Queen. Apple drinks are good, but more expensive than Beer because of their use as a sugar alternative. ; Both cow and goat are common milks and cheeses. Rabbits are also bred on these "outskirts" and in larger operations in villages for their pelts and meat.

Most people would have no issue when presented with game, goat or fish, but pork and beef are highly desirable. As is Citrus, as it does not grow very well in this region.

Carrot, Bean, Potatoes, Cabbages are cheap alternatives for more expensive vegetables, like the imported eggplant and or proteins like meat.

Cinnamon is a highly imported spice, common even among the lower middle class.

### Land




### Overhead


### Cutting Corners
Rye is a cheap grain, and many vegetables are cheap as well. Game and "poor" meat is normalized, and quality livestock is considered a mild delicacy - already much of life is cheaper than a western diet.

This also means that soups, stews, and similar meals are common food, and when paired with local forage, such as edible mushrooms, can prove to be quite tasteful. Not only is this considered culturally acceptable, it is considered an intelligent and practical choice.

### Middlemen


### Craftsmen


### Textiles
People in Prosper are mostly for furs and goat-wool. Cattle and Horse leather is more useful as other things. Canvas is more common than Linen, and much more common than the luxury import Silk.

### Preservation
There are few sources of salt in Prosper, although it is imported from both Combine and Acstow. Applesugar is fairly weak and distinctly flavored compared to other sources, but can still be used in preservatives. Cheese, Canned (with applesugar) and Pickled (generally in apple or barley vinegar) vegetables, Sausage, and Pemmican are the most common preservatives.

### Containers
Baskets and Bags are the most common transportation mediums, although barrels and boxes are still used in large operations. The pottery of the region is generally poor, and most folk import their pottery when they can.

### Mining
Prosper primarily trades with Acstow for their mining materials, although some specialties such as gems they buy from the south. While there are some operations in Prosper, with masters nearby, it's often better to import than produce.

### Magic
Prosper has access to most alchemical components, leading to a large alchemical industry in Prosper. The city of Magius holds an academy, and some of its most talented graduates work for the government as mages of war or as enchanters and artificers for their specialized needs.

### More
Prosper's people are generally well educated and hard working. While mercantilism is a common occupation, it is not a well respected one. The people of Prosper are typically not institutionally religious, they are community focused culturally. 


## Northeast Hobgoblin Territories
### Prelim
Much of the Territories are dense forest; grains are not as plentiful as meat and fruit, therefore Pemmican is the base food in these areas.

### Pemmican
By combining powdered meats and fruits with hot liquid fats and seasoning, a powerful and preservable food is made.

### Food
For selections of meat, there are many game animals to hunt and trap, and many families have small livestock, such as goat, turkey, or goose. Beef and Cow's Milk are hard to come by around here, but certain Clans have access to Cattle if they don't own them themselves.

If the times become truly tough, humanoid is an acceptable meat, although most prefer not to eat it if they can. When no other viable options present themselves (such as if a starving clan of hobgoblin fought a starving clan of humans in the hobgoblin's territory and the children need to eat today, including the un-borns in these people).

Grains are generally hard to come by, but Barley is much more plentiful than Wheat. Rye bread is relatively common at deeply established camps, but becomes rarer in younger sections of the Territories.

Wild fruits such as Apple and Blackberry are plentiful in the densest parts of the forests.
