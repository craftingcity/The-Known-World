# Fighting Styles
### Archery Mastery
- You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
### Blind Fighting Mastery
- You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
### One-Hand Style
- When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with that weapon.
- If you are wielding no Auxiliary Armor, you gain a +1 to your AC.
### Two-Hand Style
- When you engage in the Two-Weapon Fighting Bonus Action, you *can* add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. I'd recommend it.
### Duel-Hand Style
- When you are rolling damage for an attack made with a weapon you are wielding in both hands, you may, once per attack, reroll **any** 1s, 2s, or 3s that you roll on your attack's Damage Dice.
### Four-Hand Style
- Your unarmed strikes may deal 1d6 + STR bludgeoning damage on a hit, or 1d8 + STR if you are wielding no Weapons or Auxiliary Armor.
- At the beginning of each of your turns, you may deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to a creature you are currently Grappling. 
### Shield Mastery
- As a reaction, when a creature you can see within 5ft of you is targeted by an attack, you may impose Disadvantage on the roll.
- If the attack that triggered this reaction hits, you may expend and roll any number of Hit Die and subtract the total from the Attack's Damage.
### Thrown Weapon Mastery
- You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
- When you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
### Explosive Weapon Mastery
- You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
- When you hit with a Ranged Attack using an Explosive weapon, you immediately make a Reaction to make another Ranged Attack using an Explosive weapon.
### Fire Weapon Mastery
- You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
- When you hit with a Ranged Attack using an Fire weapon, you immediately make a Reaction to make another Ranged Attack using an Fire weapon.
### Tactical Mastery
- You know one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.)
- You gain one superiority die, which is a d8 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 
### Natural Weaponry Mastery
- When you are rolling damage for an attack made with a natural weapon, you may roll twice as many dice as you normally would.
