### Intro

This is the beginning of a story. A story of victory, of defeat, of success and failure. A story of heroes, of villains, and of the complex people who are both and neither. In this story, we will examine four people - each with unique needs, desires, flaws, connections - and how these four would come to work together for a common goal, if not genuinely trust each other.

Imagining the bright and lively world of Alaturmen, we overlook the luscious, wet mosslands of the southeast and then further, down into the villages and towns of the Central Third, where we see each of the four of you arrive in [[Mossburg]] for a paying job.

You've been directed to meet your peers at a bar known as 'the Araborum', where you will prepare for your working opportunity.

Who reaches Araborum first? What are you doing?

### What does the World Know?

I need to write up 4 little letters for each of our characters;

##### Leliana
*You receive a letter, handwritten and delivered for your eyes only. Even so - the message itself is coded into the otherwise pointless prose.*

```
**Operational Assignment**
Acquire the Object of Interest from the rightmost stable at Araborum, in Mossburg. You will meet with a Riphound, a Grovetender, and a Devilkin. Together, you will deliver the Object of Interest to the desk of the Captain of Enforcement within the Garrison. Activate the Object there. Disperse.

Your fee will be transferred 72 hours after the conclusion of the Operation. Prove yourself, Leliana.
```

##### KEYNA CHAR
*You receive a letter, handwritten and delivered by courier. It bears the seal of the Baron Cassindil. The letter reads...*

```
Dearest (NAME), 

I hope this letter finds you well. Your services are requested in the Araborum in Mossburg, where you will join a group of Mercenaries under the banner of SEASEC. Your cooperation is vital in this "operation", both in the physical assistance you can provide during their "operation", and in our standing as potential assets to their company - your contributions will decide a conversation regarding our continued cooperation with SEASEC, and therefore I must directly express the importance of your success, and the success of the "operation" overall. You will be travelling under the command of a 'Leilana'.

Please act in secrecy; tell no other of your goal in these regards, and destroy this missive once you have committed it to memory. I trust that this is within your abilities, and I wish you well.
```

##### Xenfer
*You receive a letter, handwritten and delivered by courier. Your circle would have sent a familiar spirit. This is from someone you don't know. The letter reads...*

```
We have a job for you, Xenfer. Go to the Araborum in Mossburg, and meet with Leliana. She is expecting you. You will travel with her and her companions over the course of the next week, during which time you will provide your services. You will be compensated well, including reimbursement on expenses occured during your time of service. This assignment is non-optional.

Glory to SEASEC.
```

##### Emilio
*You receive a magical voicemail...*

```
Hey Em, it's Paul. We're still bumping your newest shit back home, its heat! Glask talked to me about some work we need done for the Company, maybe it'll get you inspired. There's a group we need you to roll with for a bit. You'll meet them in Mossburg, at the Araborum. The cloud kid is in charge. Meet with her, and let her know you're with us. She's got the plans, so you're her muscle for this one.

Bailey has been getting better, she'll be up and att'em

Good luck, have fun!
