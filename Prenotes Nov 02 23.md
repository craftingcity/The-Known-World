### Intro

When last we left our heroes they all got fucking petrified. On a sidequest to earn some coin and reputation, a group of basilisks eventually petrified three of the four of you, leaving Nala - thankfully an alchemist in training - all alone. 

With haste, Nala took the corpses of the beasts and the still-stone forms of her friends and comrades into their Bag of Rooms, alongside all of the other magical accoutrements that fell about the battlefield during her intra-planar management.

Nala - you are the only active member of your party - what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

[[Reugb Marshes#AH26. Basalisk's Acacia Garden]]
