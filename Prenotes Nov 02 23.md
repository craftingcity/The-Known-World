### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they all got fucked. On a sidequest to earn some coin and reputation, a group of basilisks eventually petrified three of the four of you, leaving Nala - thankfully an alchemist in training - all alone. 

With haste, Nala took the corpses of the beasts and the still-stone forms of her friends and comrades into their Bag of Rooms, alongside all of the other magical accoutrements that fell about the battlefield during her intra-planar management.

Nala - you are the only active member of your party - what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

[[Reugb Marshes#AH26. Basalisk's Acacia Garden]] is the scene of the crime - and Jameson of the Magic Choppe in [[Boneborn]] is the responsible party. It's doubtful that the party will attempt to prosecute, and may even attempt to use some of Jameson's equipment. Doing so would aid Nala's attempts greatly.

Given that the party will move into the night of the 13th (which happens to be the 1st full moon of resowing), Nala has less than 22 days, which is a fine timeline.

### What happened?

Nala begins by storing the Basilisks in the Freezer room and her friends in the Garden rooms.
