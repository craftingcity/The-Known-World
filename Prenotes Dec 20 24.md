### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had completed their first contract as an informal adventuring party delivering *a caravan* to it's destination. There is nothing to be said about the driver or the contents, it was simply - as you say - not your fault. 

After spending some time in [[Coalition City]], purchasing equipment and investigating opportunities, you have elected to pursue a contract Roan acquired during your time at the Library - you will travel to [[Emorin's Plots]], where you will find [[Syther Malkovich]] and relieve them of their '*Mask of the Fallen Jester*'. If completed in honor, you stand to gain 2,500 silver each, for a total of 12,500 silver - and an increased reputation with the members of the Obra Dinn.

On your travels east, along the mountain-range-trails, you were accosted by an underprepared gang of bandits. You made quick work of them, took what little valuables they had, and moved on.

### What does the World Know?
#### [[Emorin's Plots]]
A grand bazaar of a city, people move between wide-spaced tents and cabins, buying, selling, trading, and transporting goods. The buildings become larger and more permanent as they come closer to the center of the city.

##### [[Gumlpin#R27. Old Malkovich Stronghold]]
The Old Malkovich Stronghold has been recently re-occupied by [[Syther Malkovich]] and their newly reformed gang of Bandits.

### What happened?
