# Prenotes for May 31st
- [ ] DM Screen
- [ ] Notepaper
- [ ] Prep
	- [ ] maps?
	- [ ] encounters / monsters?
	- [ ] intro / recap?

Talk with Kade about how to do Ghosts vs Demons as mechanics may represent a recurring theme;
	- ghosts dont get to take rests (short or long)
	- fiends of a certain level of power apply paralysis 

### Intro

When last we left our heroes, the party had travelled beyond the first city of this space - a dark and dreary place home to ghostly and demonic forms alike. Their childish bard sent a communication to their allies explaining your intent to avoid the cities and leave, immediately, and return to your home plane. While your immediate destination was not directly communicated, that being "a river that travels the planes", your other half should be able to recall this detail of the conversation Moses explained between himself and the Shadow Form of Hades.

Through their continued travel, the party was encountered by a wandering group of demonic forms - horribly large mouthed ape beasts - which bested and brutally ended the life of Daelith. However, while her physical form was bested, her spirit continues to travel alongside you now, though she can clearly feel the effects of her new form even for the few hours she has spent in it.

We return to them now, quietly and carefully maneuvering through this stone-tree forest. 

You have traveled for only a half day beyond the space where Daelith was removed from her physical form before the forest quickly begins to thin and you find yourselves standing upon a hill, looking down into the beginnings of a city. The building density thickens before abruptly stopping at the edge of a coastline where, a massive castle looms, and behind it, a thick and well-supported stone bridge breaks across the dark water and continues beyond your sight.

### What does the World Know?

We run [[Thanatos]] as Hexcrawl, same kinda stuff.

We might be heading back home to [[Alaturmen]] this session; if we do so, hopefully it is by [[Karenos, River's Keeper]] so that we can set down at the edge of the [[Alvalini River]] or [[Firelight Sea]] or something like that.
