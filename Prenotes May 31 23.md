# Prenotes for May 31st
- [ ] DM Screen
- [ ] Notepaper
- [ ] Prep
	- [ ] maps?
	- [ ] encounters / monsters?
	- [ ] intro / recap?

Talk with Kade about how to do Ghosts vs Demons as mechanics may represent a recurring theme;
	- ghosts dont get to take rests (short or long)
	- fiends of a certain level of power apply paralysis 

### Intro

When last we left our heroes, the party had travelled beyond the first city of this space - a dark and dreary place home to ghostly and demonic forms alike. Their childish bard sent a communication to their allies explaining your intent to avoid the cities and leave, immediately, and return to your home plane. While your immediate destination was not directly communicated, that being "a river that travels the planes", your other half should be able to recall this detail of the conversation Moses explained between himself and the Shadow Form of Hades.

Through their continued travel, the party was encountered by a wandering group of demonic forms - horribly large mouthed ape beasts - which bested and brutally ended the life of Daelith. However, while her physical form was bested, her spirit continues to travel alongside you now, though she can clearly feel the effects of her new form even for the few moments she has spent in it.

### What does the World Know?

We run [[Thanatos]] as Hexcrawl, same kinda stuff.

We might be heading back home to [[Alaturmen]] this
