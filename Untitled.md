Character focus or Plot focus?
Light hearted or serious?
- Ideally, I integrate your characters into a plot, but I'd much perfer to see you shine over my writing.
- I perfer a serious game; I want to get in character. This means that I want you to take this seriously too, play as your character, this fight is really life or death right now.
