### Opener;
> Hey. I don't understand what is happening between us.
>  I feel confused because it seems like your words are not the same as your actions. I feel like I have put the effort into making the distance between us work for you, but I do not see you doing the same for me. When I told you my schedule, and you said that Saturday worked, I was excited. I didn't hear from you and assumed you were busy, and would talk to me when you were free, but you never rescheduled. I tried to let you come to me when you told me you were busy, and it seemed like you eventually just stopped talking to me. 
>  I understand that it seems like I'm really far away, but I make the drive every week,
>  I was really hurt that you didn't invite me to your party yesterday. I think we could work things out but I need you to communicate with me about how to make our friendship work and what you are really feeling. 


> 	- that there is a fundamental power imbalance in our friendship, ie, we always do "what millie wants to do".
> 	- that you do not accept that I am growing up and making choices for myself because you believe they make me less accessible to you
