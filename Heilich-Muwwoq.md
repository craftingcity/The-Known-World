# Heilich-Muwwoq (New Ammyrain)
What was once a mining colony of humans is now the capital city of the Duergar of the [[Upper Northwestern Underdark]].

The movers and shakers fall into one of three factions, those who work for [[Taerich Da'Furik]], those who work for [[Wuer-Heur-Tuigier Da'Heggun]], and those who work for [[Yuurmin]].

## Physicality of the Holding
The long streets are cobbled in light stone and lined with tall iron lanterns of dull yellow glow. The stone buildings of the Lower Housing are slim and tall; squeezed together by their neighbors. These buildings are worn and marked, engravings and paint-tags and murals line the faces of this place. Southeast from there, the cave grows luscious grass and mushrooms at the estates of the nobles. The Eastern side of town houses the middle class, merchants, criminals, mercenaries, and the like.

## Population Distribution
Nearly all of the unchained population of Heilich is Duergar, with the exception of a few bands of mercenaries or traders who have proven themselves worthy allies to the town.

## Defenses
The Da'Furik and Da'Heggun families each hire guard to the local Muwwoq-Gueb (Muwwoq-Protectors).
