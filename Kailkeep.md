Kailkeep is a place of legendary danger; noone that has traveled there has returned alive

Kailkeep is home to an ingenues and evil race of Kobold. They live in the mountain, and hold the skies above with their ground-to-air weaponry. From below, their home is quite a secret; more legend than fact to the common folk. There are few entrances to Kailkeep that are not hidden, and there are fewer still that the Kobolds actually use; the others being false entrances to their trapped chambers. 

Dragons are honored guests here, even the "good" ones. It is legend that the dragon [[Kakurak]] has bravely entered the Mountain Hell, were he met his.
