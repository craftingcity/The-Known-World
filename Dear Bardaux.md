Dear Bardaux,

There is no telling how long you have been in this place of evil.

Since your capture you have been falling in and out of both consciousness and a sense of reality. You have been beaten, cut, wrenched, pulled, severed, burned, broken, snapped, whipped, impaled. These drow have been torturing you with one aim; 

"What can you tell us about Varis? What about his sister? How long have you known them? How long have you known Vanqua - the boy?"

These questions and more.

I request of you two checks - a Constitution save with the intention of learning what, if anything, you divulged, and a perception .
