Dear Bardaux,

The following depicts a description of your time in this place, including a, from my perception, non-graphic description of torture.

At the end, I'll ask you to make some dice rolls.
















There is no telling how long you have been in this place of evil.

Since your capture you have been falling in and out of both consciousness and a sense of reality. 

You have been beaten, cut, wrenched, pulled, severed, burned, broken, snapped, whipped, impaled. A group of drow - at least more than one - have been torturing you with their gruesome implements.

They mean to divulge information from you;

"What can you tell us about Varis? What about his sister? How long have you known them? How long have you known Vanqua - the boy?"

These questions and more. They ask about everything - things they shouldn't know.




I request of you two checks - a Constitution Save with the intention of learning what, if anything, you divulged, and a Perception check with the intention of what, if anything, you learned about this place and these people - both of which will be at disadvantage;

You have four points of Exhaustion (see Appendix A: Conditions in your Players Handbook).
