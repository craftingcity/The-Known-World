Question 1: What do you look like?

Question 2: How old are you?

Question 3: What is your greatest fear?

Question 4: What was your childhood like? Your parents? Do you have siblings?

Question 5: Where are you from? America still contained meaningful regional differences. American settlers were living in Missouri since 1803, so there is a distinct Western identity, as well as from the more developed North East (no slavery) and the pro-slavery South. The West at the time was also a beacon for Scots-Irish, Germans, and other Europeans to lesser extents.

Question 6: How long have you been a soldier? What is your rank (anything below major)?
Officers often fought in the Mexican-American war of 1846, while some soldiers are just
volunteers new to fighting.

Question 7: What keeps you from giving up (or do you give up easily)?

Question 8: Greatest failure, and how it illustrates your flaws?

Question 9: What secret are you taking to the grave?

Question 10: What is in your pockets (what items do you have on you)? I’d assume some
soldiers equipment at least.

Question 11: How do you behave around and relate to others?

Question 12: What is your primary job? What skills are tied to that?

Question 13: What are your hobbies? Do you possess any significant skills that aren’t tied to
being a soldier?

Question 14: Do you have any experiences with magic or the Occult beyond the whispers
you’ve heard? Magic in this setting is semi-rare, you’re welcome to have experience or some
abilities, but it’s unlikely that you would be a significantly experienced spellcaster yourself. You
might know a spell or have an item or nothing at all. That sort of thing.

Question 15: What is your name?

Question 16: Is there anything else you need me to know?
