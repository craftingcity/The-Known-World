Lincoln’s 1860 election victory catalyzed the south into secession, but it did not birth the Confederacy. The two crazed slaveholders in office prior – Pierce, Buchannan – appointed their ilk in every territory and oversaw the transfer of arms from federal arsenals to slaveholding mobs. The wave of secession finally crashed when 13 federal arsenals across the South and East of the country were captured in 1861, without a fight. A single arsenal was saved in the West – St. Louis. 

The West was a battleground completely unlike the East. The East was complacent, and incestuously tied to the South. Their generals were slave owners, their friends were the generals they fought against, and together those friends happily concocted a brother-against- brother tragedy that justified a slow war. To leave time to make amends. A disastrous lie. 

The Confederacy had already inflicted half a decade of pro-slavery terror in the West when they took the arsenals, and Kansans, confused by the inaction of their Eastern countrymen, formed their own volunteer army. Immigrants, bereaved volunteers, resettled North-Easterners (the most violent abolitionists), captured and shot the traitors down-river from the St. Louis arsenal. They were blamed for starting the war for their trouble. The ensuing counter-reaction of Confederate violence throughout Missouri and Kansas lasted for over two years and justified the complete destruction of the slave-owner way of life. 

It is March 1863. Three months ago, each of you embarked on a damned campaign to sack the distended plantation-fortress along the Missouri River, Vicksburg. The first three months were a waste – similar to the slow war on the Eastern Front. General Grant has just taken control over the assault on Vicksburg, and the end of the Confederacy is being discussed. But familiar habits return during hard times. Your commanding officer, a turn-coat captain by the name of Le Blanc, refused this morning to advance along your river route to provide infantry support to the brown-water navy. 

The four of you – loyal abolitionists – abandoned your unit to provide critical covering fire. You’ve advanced into the outskirts of a hostile, fortified confederate Missourian city along a river of the same name. You’ve bought some time, but not enough. Now, with your column in the distance behind you and Grant’s column firing from the East, you’re trapped between competing infantry in front and on the flank. You’ve done just enough that the Navy can fight for its life. The surrounding buildings are advancing to ruination as your own boats fire near your position, and some Confederate scouts have detected your position. 

Trapped, with Missouri March crawling down your uniforms, worming its cold into your hearts, you light a fire and tell some stories. About ghosts, the friends you’ve lost, what the morning might bring, about the enemy watching you, and the cruel irony of your position near the river. This isn’t your first cold, dark night outside Vicksburg. You’ve seen strange lights, heard strange whispers from too far away. Confederates praying for your downfall. Other voices, speaking in a way you can’t make sense of. The work you’ve done has brought the Confederacy to its breaking point. It sold its soul long ago, but now the slavers in Missouri are selling theirs too. You’ve threatened violence on their bodies, their land, and their property, but the dark things they’ve made covenant with in the night are too horrible to meet Grant’s forces in the light of day. Tonight, you can hear them too.



Question 1: What do you look like?

Question 2: How old are you?

Question 3: What is your greatest fear?

Question 4: What was your childhood like? Your parents? Do you have siblings?

Question 5: Where are you from? America still contained meaningful regional differences. American settlers were living in Missouri since 1803, so there is a distinct Western identity, as well as from the more developed North East (no slavery) and the pro-slavery South. The West at the time was also a beacon for Scots-Irish, Germans, and other Europeans to lesser extents.

Question 6: How long have you been a soldier? What is your rank (anything below major)?
Officers often fought in the Mexican-American war of 1846, while some soldiers are just
volunteers new to fighting.

Question 7: What keeps you from giving up (or do you give up easily)?

Question 8: Greatest failure, and how it illustrates your flaws?

Question 9: What secret are you taking to the grave?

Question 10: What is in your pockets (what items do you have on you)? I’d assume some
soldiers equipment at least.

Question 11: How do you behave around and relate to others?

Question 12: What is your primary job? What skills are tied to that?

Question 13: What are your hobbies? Do you possess any significant skills that aren’t tied to
being a soldier?

Question 14: Do you have any experiences with magic or the Occult beyond the whispers
you’ve heard? Magic in this setting is semi-rare, you’re welcome to have experience or some
abilities, but it’s unlikely that you would be a significantly experienced spellcaster yourself. You
might know a spell or have an item or nothing at all. That sort of thing.

Question 15: What is your name?

Question 16: Is there anything else you need me to know?
