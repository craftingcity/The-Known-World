### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were trapped in time and crystal - amber, to be specific. On your way to transport this massive slab, you simply touched it, and have been forced to fight in this disorienting space for the dragon claws being held by this place's guardians. Having survived them, you collected five of their items in a raised depository. For a moment, there was no change, but slowly the walls began to slow their shifting, and you began to hear a great scraping - something has opened, presenting an exit, further danger, or both.

### What does the World Know?

We get to fight Tymirek! He wants to leave, but he's an asshole (and has nothing to give), so he might have to scrap to get out of here. We can try to talk to them if they don't just attack us right away. He is (roughly) a [Gold Wyrmling](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=gold-dragon-wyrmling), but probably tougher.
