## Romeo, cousin of Cucu

## Index
#### Day One
Today is the 25th of Resowing, in the 105th year. Today marks the first day of my journey, and I'm writing this because I want to keep track of what I did and how I can improve. I am leaving for the Old Empire - Minyostalma. Micky says people come out of there all the time with wicked rocks and coins that they palm off for a ton of money.
