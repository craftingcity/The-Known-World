### she/her

> A large goblin woman with more than a dozen scars across her body, her arms reach below her knees. She is clearly strong, but she is dirty, and obviously hasn't cared for her things in some time. More than anything, she looks distant - like she thinks she shouldn't be here.

### Background
#### Early Life

Grew up in Northern Prosper. I grew up in a group home, and it was nice enough. I stayed in town as I got older, and eventually I signed up for the Militia. We ended up fighting some Blood Clan trying to fuck with us, and I got *really hurt*. I had a dream where something asked if I wanted to live, and I was scared, and I think I said yes. I woke up, and I wasn't gonna die anymore so I just left. Things are a little foggy now though. 

I haven't been back to see any of my siblings, or anyone from my unit. I didn't stop walking for a while. Someone asked if I knew someone, and the name caught, so now I'm going with her to check up on them. A friend of a friend.
