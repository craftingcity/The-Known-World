# Zari Franx
## Goblin of Prosper
## Volunteer Militant, MIA
## Warlock (3)
### she/her

> A large goblin woman with more than a dozen scars across her body, her arms reach below her knees. She is clearly strong, but she is dirty, and obviously hasn't cared for her things in some time. More than anything, she looks distant - like she thinks she shouldn't be here. 

Zari is a frontline fighter largely because it is what she knows more than anything. She doesn't quite have 'a deathwish', but more of a passive ideation towards the ending of her life. She isn't upset, but she has been disturbed by the magic that brought her from the brink of the world before, and won't be happy to experience it again.

## Roleplaying
### "Ah, fuck. Again?"

### Mannerism & Disposition
Zari is...
	- SIMPLE
	- SEEKING
	- REGRETFUL

### Background
#### Early Life

Grew up in Northern Prosper. I grew up in a group home, and it was nice enough. I stayed in town as I got older, and eventually I signed up for the Militia. We ended up fighting some Blood Clan trying to fuck with us, and I got *really hurt*. I had a dream where something asked if I wanted to live, and I was scared, and I think I said yes. I woke up, and I wasn't gonna die anymore so I just left. Things are a little foggy now though. 

I haven't been back to see any of my siblings, or anyone from my unit. I didn't stop walking for a while. Someone asked if I knew someone, and the name caught, so now I'm going with her to check up on them. A friend of a friend.

## Important Knowledge

#### Session 1: The Mysterious Travelers

We travelled with a pair of guys (Raz and Ed) before we got jumped by some goblins with guns, and turns out the guys were the King's Right Hand (Bathazar) and one of the a'Huuracs ([[Yandee a'Huruuc]])!

#### Session 2: The 

Our attackers all have a matching tattooed goblin head symbol. We continue to travel, and as we reach Magius, night falls upon us. We head through the outer town, it's a little worse for wear, and some protesters are talking about Druid Cabals and Goblin Heritage Lands. We're let into the walls by a satyr professor in purple silk robe. A Professor Sunshield.

Adriana's Stall, mention Raz, get a nice deal.
