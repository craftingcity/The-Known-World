### Mannerism & Disposition

### Background
#### Early Life

Grew up in Northern Prosper. I grew up in a group home, and it was nice enough. I stayed in town as I got older, and eventually I signed up for the Militia, fought against some Blood Clan trying to fuck with us, and I ended up *really hurt*. I had a dream where something asked if I wanted to live, and I was scared, and I think I said yes. I woke up, and I wasn't gonna die anymore so I just left the fight. Things are a little foggy now though.
