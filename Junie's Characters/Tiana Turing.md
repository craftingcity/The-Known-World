## Roleplaying
###### "Present your evidence for this conclusion..."
Tiana is...
	- CURIOUS; ever questioning
	- SHELTERED; her experience in life has been controlled 
	- THOUGHTFUL; thinking before she speaks

### Mannerism & Disposition

- Tiana is a sheltered, curious, and currently performing an act of rebellion. She does not truly realize the potential for danger she has walked herself into.
- Tiana's claims to experience are in a simulated or controlled environment, she has never been put in true danger with her father by her side.

### Background
#### Early Life (c. ???AF - ???AF)
In her early life, Tiana was raised by her platonic pair of fathers - [[Dimble Turing]] and [[Scree'up]] - who taught her to be curious, honest, and kind. She was consistently brought along during her fathers' research expeditions, where she became as proficient in adventuring skills as a preteen can, and under the tutoring of her fathers, she would come to learn the art of spellcasting.

Being overly curious, and mildly sheltered, she came to seek unsupervised adventure - leading her to her be in her current predicament.
