# Tiana Turing
## Gnome Wizard, Auxiliarist (Wizard 3)
### she/they

> Standing at 3'9", Tiana wears a practical brown canvas cloak and a comparably large backpack.

Tiana is a young gnome with practical experience in the field - under direct supervision, in a stable environment. She's brought along her familiar - a brown shepard dog named Compu.

## Roleplaying
###### "Present your evidence for this conclusion..."
Tiana is...
	- CURIOUS; ever questioning
	- SHELTERED; her experience in life has been controlled 
	- THOUGHTFUL; thinking before she speaks

### Mannerism & Disposition

- Tiana is a sheltered, curious, and currently performing an act of rebellion. She does not truly realize the potential for danger she has walked herself into.
- Tiana's claims to experience are in a simulated or controlled environment, she has never been put in true danger with her father by her side.

### Background
#### Early Life (c. ???AF - ???AF)
In her early life, Tiana was raised by her platonic pair of fathers - [[Dimble Turing]] and [[Scree'up]] - who taught her to be curious, honest, and kind. She was consistently brought along during her fathers' research expeditions, where she became as proficient in adventuring skills as a preteen can, and under the tutoring of her fathers, she would come to learn the art of spellcasting.

Being overly curious, and mildly sheltered, she came to seek unsupervised adventure in the North - leading her to her be in her current predicament.

## Important Knowledge
#### Session 1; Welcome to Castaway Cove

###### The Party

- Kaldrin, the Sloppy Cleric
- Isabella, the Snotty Rogue

###### The Ship
- Bill, the Cook
- Dashara, the Quartermaster
- Kade, Yeoman

We've washed upon the shore of some island - it looks like there's some civilization off a ways, but we were attacked by big crabs!

#### Session 2; Exploring Castaway Cove
Before we could get off the beach, Max Delmare & Soju run up to us and tried to help. Soju is the de facto Governor. "The island was once called Endara". The town, Castaway Cove, has roughly 13 residents and only a few permanent structures. 

Soju has enchanted part of the forest to isolate 'Castaway Cove' from the rest of the Island. There is another settlement North of here. Castaway Cove is communally socialist. When Soju got here, some of their comrades appeared on other parts of the Island. 

Grom was here before you couldn't leave, has been for 27 years. He's the shopkeep.

The Shoreside Inn of Castaway Cove has been overrun by a number of vermin and varmints.

We spoke to Grom, who said 

- 'Stuff doesn't stay dead here' since the fog came 18 years ago. 
- Buckaneer Break / Brandeywine is a 'shady, rough, and tumble' settlement to the North. You'd have to go through the Grung, a group of frogkin, to get there.
- Torrin 'got dark' and disappeared 18 years ago, at the same time as the fog came.

We're going to clear out the old tavern. We encountered rats.

#### Session 3; The Shoreside Inn
###### Todo;
- [  ] Clear the upper floors of the Shoreside Inn
- [ x ] Get a Map from Grom
- [ x ] Gather supplies to bring Compu back

A guy that probably should have died was muttering "He said it would give me strength, it was a gift, he gave me this - you, you shouldn't be here" sitting at a table on the second floor. He pulls out a hand-crossbow and shoots at Kaldrin, and more Rats come to fight. Oh no he's a were-rat, but we cornered him and beat his shit. He had a page of a journal on him that said the 'Gift of Skin and Teeth', Kaldrin found another peice that says 'Trapped them in the cellar --- stashed the key --- hallway --- compartment --- ***uncontrollable***.' Pick opened a door into a lounge/hall occupied by three skeletons.

Grom gave us a map he made. Apparently, there was a Garrison by the Tower, but it's missing.

Carved; "Speak the vows, bind the halves, light the flame". In the book of vows; "From breath to silence I remain by your side." Pick was reading from the book, so I had to yell at her - I feel bad for yelling, but I think it was the right thing to do.

#### Session 4; The Shoreside Inn (cont.)
###### Todo;
- [  ] Clear the upper floors of the Shoreside Inn
- [  ] Figure out what happened to Torrin
	- Bring Grom over to ID bodies?
- [  ] Scan the Shoreside Inn with Detect Magic
- [  ] Figure out what kind of Zombies these are?

This Torin guy got fucking cursed or something by this stuff - something about "the Hollow Man". Oh we found him, he's a big zombie without bones and he's so stinky I'm thinking something like a Gas Mask would be a good find. We need to go through everything with Detect Magic and stuff, but I think we're clear - double check the very top floor for hostiles, oh and clear the cellar.

#### Session 5: The Shoreside Inn (cont.)
###### Todo;
- [  ] Clear the upper floors of the Shoreside Inn
- [  ] Figure out what happened to Torrin
	- Bring Grom over to ID bodies?
- [  ] Scan the Shoreside Inn with Detect Magic
- [  ] Figure out what kind of Zombies these are?

A carving on the wall of the bunkhouse says; 'The dead remember. The dead regret.' Each of the zombies here are wearing the same uniforms of a tunic, leather pants, and holsters - but no weapons.

We opened the box, it had money, a sealed scroll case, and a bloodstained scrap of a map - similar to the map we got from Grom - that says "The tower rebuilt, the tide will rise, the living bound beneath the wave" and shows the tower built with the garrison 'below it'.

We heard footsteps at midnight while folks were watching, so we know we're not alone. Continuing to explore the Inn, we find more interesting chests and keys and the like. We find another page of Torrin's journal, and in the Attic, theres so many skeletons! Ahh!

##### Wizardly Quill
At 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:
	- The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
	- The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.

	- When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
	- When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
