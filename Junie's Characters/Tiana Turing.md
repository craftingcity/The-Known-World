# Tiana Turing
## Gnome Wizard, Auxiliarist (Wizard 1)
### she/they

> Standing at 3'9", Tiana wears a practical brown canvas cloak and a comparably large backpack.

Tiana is a young gnome with practical experience in the field - under direct supervision, in a stable environment. She's brought along her familiar - a brown shepard dog named Compu.

## Roleplaying
###### "Present your evidence for this conclusion..."
Tiana is...
	- CURIOUS; ever questioning
	- SHELTERED; her experience in life has been controlled 
	- THOUGHTFUL; thinking before she speaks

### Mannerism & Disposition

- Tiana is a sheltered, curious, and currently performing an act of rebellion. She does not truly realize the potential for danger she has walked herself into.
- Tiana's claims to experience are in a simulated or controlled environment, she has never been put in true danger with her father by her side.

### Background
#### Early Life (c. ???AF - ???AF)
In her early life, Tiana was raised by her platonic pair of fathers - [[Dimble Turing]] and [[Scree'up]] - who taught her to be curious, honest, and kind. She was consistently brought along during her fathers' research expeditions, where she became as proficient in adventuring skills as a preteen can, and under the tutoring of her fathers, she would come to learn the art of spellcasting.

Being overly curious, and mildly sheltered, she came to seek unsupervised adventure - leading her to her be in her current predicament.

##### Spellcasting (Prep 7)
- You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
- Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook.

##### Arcane Recovery
- Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

##### Wizardly Quill
At 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:
	- The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
	- The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.
	- You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.

##### Awakened Spellbook
At 2nd level, while you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:
	- You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
	- When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
	- When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
