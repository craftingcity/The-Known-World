# Tiana Turing
## Gnome Wizard, Auxiliarist (Wizard 5)
### she/they

> Standing at 3'9", Tiana wears a practical brown canvas cloak and a comparably large backpack.

Tiana is a young gnome with practical experience in the field - under direct supervision, in a stable environment. She's brought along her familiar - a brown shepherd dog named Compu.

## Roleplaying
###### "Present your evidence for this conclusion..."
Tiana is...
	- CURIOUS; ever questioning
	- SHELTERED; her experience in life has been controlled 
	- THOUGHTFUL; thinking before she speaks

### Mannerism & Disposition

- Tiana is a sheltered, curious, and currently performing an act of rebellion. She does not truly realize the potential for danger she has walked herself into.
- Tiana's claims to experience are in a simulated or controlled environment, she has never been put in true danger with her father by her side.

### Background
#### Early Life (c. ???AF - ???AF)
In her early life, Tiana was raised by her platonic pair of fathers - [[Dimble Turing]] and [[Scree'up]] - who taught her to be curious, honest, and kind. She was consistently brought along during her fathers' research expeditions, where she became as proficient in adventuring skills as a preteen can, and under the tutoring of her fathers, she would come to learn the art of spellcasting.

Being overly curious, and mildly sheltered, she came to seek unsupervised adventure in the North - leading her to her be in her current predicament.

## Important Knowledge
#### Session 1; Welcome to Castaway Cove

###### The Party
- Pick, the Nervous Fighter
- Kaldrin, the Sloppy Cleric
- Isabella, the Snotty Rogue

###### The Ship
- Bill, the Cook
- Dashara, the Quartermaster
- Kade, Yeoman
- Raken, Master at Arms
- Farina Fairwind, the Captain
- Vimak (V), the First Mate
- Sester Baliax (Boats), the Boswens Mate
- Brinn, Carpenter
- Roe, a Crewman

We've washed upon the shore of some island - it looks like there's some civilization off a ways, but we were attacked by big crabs!

#### Session 2; Exploring Castaway Cove
Before we could get off the beach, Max Delmare & Soju run up to us and tried to help. Soju is the de facto Governor. "The island was once called Endara". The town, *Castaway Cove*, has roughly 13 residents and only a few permanent structures. 

Soju has enchanted part of the forest to isolate '*Castaway Cove*' from the rest of the Island. There is another settlement North of here. *Castaway Cove* is communally socialist. When Soju got here, some of their comrades appeared on other parts of the Island. 

Grom was here before you couldn't leave, has been for 27 years. He's the shopkeep.

The Shoreside Inn of *Castaway Cove* has been overrun by a number of vermin and varmints.

We spoke to Grom, who said 

- 'Stuff doesn't stay dead here' since the fog came 18 years ago. 
- Buckaneer Break / Brandeywine is a 'shady, rough, and tumble' settlement to the North. You'd have to go through the Grung, a group of frogkin, to get there.
- Torrin 'got dark' and disappeared 18 years ago, at the same time as the fog came.

We're going to clear out the old tavern. We encountered rats.

#### Session 3; The Shoreside Inn
###### Todo;
- [  ] Clear the upper floors of the Shoreside Inn
- [ x ] Get a Map from Grom
- [ x ] Gather supplies to bring Compu back

A guy that probably should have died was muttering "He said it would give me strength, it was a gift, he gave me this - you, you shouldn't be here" sitting at a table on the second floor. He pulls out a hand-crossbow and shoots at Kaldrin, and more Rats come to fight. Oh no he's a were-rat, but we cornered him and beat his shit. He had a page of a journal on him that said the 'Gift of Skin and Teeth', Kaldrin found another peice that says 'Trapped them in the cellar --- stashed the key --- hallway --- compartment --- ***uncontrollable***.' Pick opened a door into a lounge/hall occupied by three skeletons.

Grom gave us a map he made. Apparently, there was a Garrison by the Tower, but it's missing. 

![[20250624_184256.jpg]]

Carved; "Speak the vows, bind the halves, light the flame". In the book of vows; "From breath to silence I remain by your side." Pick was reading from the book, so I had to yell at her - I feel bad for yelling, but I think it was the right thing to do.

#### Session 4; The Shoreside Inn (cont.)
###### Todo;
- [  ] Clear the upper floors of the Shoreside Inn
- [  ] Figure out what happened to Torrin
	- Bring Grom over to ID bodies?
- [  ] Scan the Shoreside Inn with Detect Magic
- [  ] Figure out what kind of Zombies these are?

This Torin guy got fucking cursed or something by this stuff - something about "the Hollow Man". Oh we found him, he's a big zombie without bones and he's so stinky I'm thinking something like a Gas Mask would be a good find. We need to go through everything with Detect Magic and stuff, but I think we're clear - double check the very top floor for hostiles, oh and clear the cellar.

#### Session 5: The Shoreside Inn (cont.)
###### Todo;
- [ x ] Clear the upper floors of the Shoreside Inn
- [ x ] Figure out what happened to Torrin
	- Bring Grom over to ID bodies?
- [ x ] Scan the Shoreside Inn with Detect Magic
- [  ] Figure out what kind of Zombies these are?

A carving on the wall of the bunkhouse says; 'The dead remember. The dead regret.' Each of the zombies here are wearing the same uniforms of a tunic, leather pants, and holsters - but no weapons.

We opened the box, it had money, a sealed scroll case, and a bloodstained scrap of a map - similar to the map we got from Grom - that says "The tower rebuilt, the tide will rise, the living bound beneath the wave" and shows the tower built with the garrison 'below it'.

We heard footsteps at midnight while folks were watching, so we know we're not alone. Continuing to explore the Inn, we find more interesting chests and keys and the like. We find another page of Torrin's journal, and in the Attic, theres so many skeletons! Ahh!

#### Session 6: The Shoreside Inn (cont.)
###### Todo;
- [ x ] Kill the Skeletons
- [  ] Check the Basement

Ahh, there are still a lot of skeletons! This main guy was talking to us for a bit, asking why were here and stuff before more skeletons came from above. We gottem, and found a bunch of stuff in boxes, including pages of Torrin's journal. Torrin is a madman, I think, and has been for a while. Lenny was described as an Assistant, a Test Subject, and a Faithful Animal. We're dealing with some kind of transformation curse, lycanthropy I think its called. 

The Inn was sealed before the Undead showed up. I'm thinking that what Torrin was doing and the coming of the fog are related. The factions have become less trusting as time continues.

In the light of the wee morning, Tiana spotted a crashed ship on the Reef, but I could only see it for a moment.

#### Session 7: The Shoreside Inn (cont.)
- [ x ] Check the Basement
- [ x ] Save the Newly Weds
- [  ] ~~Clean up the Inn & Set up in there~~
	- (  ) Find Lenny or Torrin
	- ( x ) Handle Undead prevention (see *Veinlock Gate*)
	- (  ) Improve travel capability?
- [  ] Get a 100gp pearl for Identify

We bought potions from Grom, he should be getting a new supply soon though. We want to deal with the newlyweds before we go deal with the basement. Dealing with the Newlyweds was a bit of trouble, but we figured it out by following the ritual works, and we got a little necklace of protection.

We found the *Veinlock Gate*, and it seems like maybe Torrin wanted to open it up - but maybe he didn't want it opened, he was talking about whispers behind it, and then he went on to talk about all the magic items we got. Torrin mentioned a Grimoire he was using. "The tower calls to me", he moved out of the Inn at some point. 

Soju knows that the *Sunken Pyre* and the *Silver Grove* are places on the island, in the Lizardkin territory and the Apekin territory.

The Amulet of Twofold Drowning is related to the Grung somehow.

#### Session 8: Rally the Castaways!
- [ x ] Find Maggie
- [ x ] Figure where to go or what to do?
	- (  ) Find Lenny, Torrin, and the Hollow-Man
	- (  ) Find the Veinlock Macguffins (0/5)
	- (  ) Find our Shipmates
	- (  ) Go to Buckaneer Break, just because it could be cool
	- (  ) Go to the Tower or the Barracks, because they're mysterious
	- (  ) Cast Identify on the Veinlock Gate

We talked to the Castaways, and they were chill with the Inn being haunted kinda, but, yknow...

We're probably gonna head out, but we talked to a lumberjack named Maggie! She's gonna come travel and explore with us. We will eventually head to the Tower, but we just need to get moving first.

The Entrance and Exits of the *Castaway Cove* are marked by pairs of heart-shaped trees. Speak 'Throm-ka' to part the vines and pass upon the path. There is a circular path around the lake that extended to the points of interest of the island.

Leaving the Cove, the change in scenery is intense. We're caught out by some snakes, and some viney-masses in the shape of humanoid-ish shapes, and we fought them off.

#### Session 9: Beyond the Cove...

We explore the farmstead, resting for a while and gathering some of the stuff here. We continue onward, and eventually camp down in an abandoned, broken down building. Some ghoulies and goblins come attack us!

Torrin came to us in a firey vision over an altar after the fight.

#### Session 10: Beyond the Cove... (cont. )

The rain stopped. We cleaned up the battle and went back to bed. As we travel, we found a person, a purple Tiefling by the name of Cobblestar Woosh. He's transporting flour to *Castaway Cove*. He needs our help to recreate a potion he was supposed to deliver; he gave us the recipe for it.

'Russel' is the guy who makes a 'The Pocket Shop', and Cobblestar will give us one if we get everything for him - but he got spooked before we could ask more questions. Snakes and a Basilisk came and attacked us!

#### Session 11: Beyond the Cove... (cont.)

Cobblestar took off, and we stick around to patch our wounds. We travel for a quarter day before we enter a more canopied area around *Driftfen Lake* and begin to actually rest - but we get interrupted by undead frogkin! 

#### Session 12: Beyond the Cove... (cont.)
I'm calling the hour or so of sleep we got my short rest for [[#Arcane Recovery]], so I'm grabbing my 3rd level spellslot back in the hopes of Hasting Maggie again.

We ended up fighting some living Grung, and we had to switch back and forth on resting till everyone is ready - we gained the benefits of a long rest.

We got into combat with more Grung...

#### Session 13: Into the Swamps...

... and combat continues. We won.

We keep travelling, and we finally get to make a choice about where we go - we can follow the path north, towards the mountain, east towards the central island, or west towards the swamp. We choose west, hoping to end up in the swamps, where we seek the Heartcoal of the Sunken Pyre.

We begin to take our rest for the night, and some floating lights approached us!

#### Session 14: Into the Swamps... (cont.)

We meet a swamp man named Bramble. He has a pet otter. The lizardfolk call themselves Vresk. The city is called Vresktal, and Bramble trades his swamp crystals there for charms and such. He said they grant protection from the natural threats, but he wouldn't immediately give us some, so I fucking killed him, and took them. 

#### Session 15: Into the Swamps... (cont.)
*Mourning Coil* - Whenever an undead comes within 30ft it emits a scream audible from 120 feet.

*Whispering Skull of Varr'thul (req. attune)* - While carried, 'Revenants' and similar undead have disadvantage against you, and you resist necrotic damage against them, and 1/day, command word, within 30ft those creatures must succeed on DC 15 Wisdom or be Turned.

Vresk's Shack is Hallowed. We take a nap and move on. To the swamp.

We reach a fork, the left path has a cloak on a branch worn by a member of our crew!

We fight some spiders down that way.

#### Session 16: Into the Swamps... (cont.)

##### Arcane Recovery (+3 Slot-Level / Rest)
- Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

##### Wizardly Quill (BA)
At 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:
	- The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
	- The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.
	- You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.

##### Awakened Spellbook (1/1)
At 2nd level, while you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:
	- You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
	- When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
	- When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. **Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.**

##### Telekinetic (BA)
At 4th level, Tiana takes the [[#Telekinetic]] Feat;
- You can cast *mage hand* without verbal or somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand invisible.
- As a bonus action, you can try to *telekinetically shove* one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this save.

##### Manifest Mind (BA, -/1+ summon, 3/3 spells)
At 6th level, as a bonus action, while you are holding the Awakened Spellbook, you can cause it to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The Awakened Spellbook is *intangible* and *doesn't occupy its space*, and it *sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius*.

While manifested, the Awakened Spellbook *can hear and see*, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The Awakened Spellbook can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required). You can cast spells on your turn as if you were in the Awakened Spellbook's space a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

As a bonus action, you can cause the Awakened Spellbook to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The Awakened Spellbook stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts [Dispel Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic) on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the Awakened Spellbook as a bonus action.

Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.
