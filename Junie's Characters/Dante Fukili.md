# Dante Kukili
## Gnoll Gunslinger (Fighter 2, Rouge Scout 3)
### she/her

> Standing at 4'10", Dante is not a physically imposing Gnoll, but the Durandurm Carbine slung across her back and the dozen tactical pouches suggest she's still a threat. In a world where size is strength, and strength is power, Dante breaks the mold with her prowess in tactics and marksmanship.
