# Dante 'the Reaper' Kukili
## Gnoll Thief, Gunslinger (Fighter 2, Rouge Scout 3)
### she/her

> Standing at 4'10", Dante is not a physically imposing Gnoll, but the Durandurm Carbine slung across her back and the dozen tactical pouches suggest she's still a threat. In a world where size is strength, and strength is power, Dante breaks the mold with her prowess in tactics and marksmanship. 

Dante is a 20-year-old Gnoll Gunslinger with lifelong allegiance to Cobalt and his Noble Thieves. 

## Roleplaying
###### "Fuck this, move already!"
### Mannerism & Disposition
Dante is...
	- AMBITIOUS; always progressing her goals
	- LOYAL; the last to leave a bad situation
	- CONNIVING; a lair and a cheat
	- RESOURCEFUL; always going to find a way to win

### Background
#### Early Life
Dante was born in the summer of 095AF into the [[Wabys]] community of [[Cobalt's Thieves]] in the southern reaches of [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]]. 

Dante was not raised by her parents, who were fighting for the survival of their home, but rather the permanent residents of [[Wabys]]. She found mentorship with a man who had come from the north, a place he called 'the Old City', where he fought and survived a daily war, much as her parents and some day she would do.

She would come to be enamored by his stories, and would quietly watch and perform the trainings he led for the graduating Thieves. She loved live fire exercises the most; the sound of the blaster fire, the synchronous click and pop of the troops reloading, and the uniquely altered smell of the air after the day is done, it was almost intoxicating. 

#### The Obsession
It wasn't until she held her own blaster that she knew. She had her Obsession. Aim, shoot, count, reload, reposition, rally, push, call, it was in those moments that she felt whole, that she felt worthy. 

Shooting something until it's dead is, for her, better than sex. Operating a blaster is better than any drug. To Dante, the thrill of pulling the trigger eclipses all other pleasures, a singular devotion that makes her feel alive, powerful, and undeniably significant in a world fraught with danger.

#### Leaving Cobalt
The eventual death of her parents left Dante little reason to stay in [[Wabys]], and her trainings left her feeling unchallenged, underutilized, and bored. She had the opportunity to join the monotonous struggle that is life in the desert, but recalling the stories of her mentor, she decided to leave [[Cobalt's Thieves]] in search of her of stories to tell, her own trainings to lead, and the fabled 'Old City' her mentor once came from.

She bought her way east, across the [[Alvalini River]] and into [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]], where she has worked as a mercenary since.

Day to day, she spends most of her money on ammunition. Food and Water are things she can scavenge or hunt for, but her need for drugs, supplies, and jobs mean she's been working her way from town to town, where she'll spend a few days to scavenge and hunt before committing to another job or set of jobs. 

## Important Knowledge
- Dante is the sexy, gay, bandito/villainess from the dark-western that is the Desert. She's proud that she's scary, but it really is isolating and lonely...
- Her mentor worked in 'the Old City', which is very interesting to her, and something she might get really committed to.

##### Features
###### Gnoll Heritage (T)
When you hit with an unarmed melee attack, you may add an additional 1d4 slashing damage to the damage you would normally deal. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on your turn, you may use a bonus action to move up to half your speed and make an unarmed melee attack.

###### Second Wind (BA)
