### Intro

When last we left our hero, they had survived a close encounter with a group of Fallen soldiers. After noticing their party-mates complete retreat, Ash decided to stick alongside the Delta 3 Mercenary Squad - with Bubbles at the helm.

While the information you had come to the Base for would certainly still be valuable, Delta 3's primary objective is the elimination of the nuisances operating out of the Western Hangar. 

You and Delta 3 approached, but failed to maintain the element of surprise, and this combat has begun with a bang.

### What does the World Know?
A small group four of Scavs has been preventing passage from the Shipyard to the Base by trapping the region, reducing the profits of the Company for a number of Weeks at this point.

The Scavs have collected at least one shipment of Arms intended for the Company, and a number of kits from looted corpses;

	- In Storage
		- (8x) Pineapple Grenade
		- (8x) Shoebox AP Mine
		- (3x) Hill Shaped Mine
		- (1x) Camelot Detector
		- (1x) 
	- Antoy
	- Burk
	- Cherish
	- Tynan
