### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had survived a less than prepared fight against a group of elder basilisks thanks to Nala's expert alchemical skills. They have since returned to town, the exhaustion of your petrification behind you. 

The [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] is 21 days away. You have reason to believe *something* will occur on the 8th of Weeding related to the Occult Infernal Invasion that has been persistent for some time now. 

What do you do?
