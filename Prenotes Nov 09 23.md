### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had survived a less than prepared fight against a group of elder basilisks thanks to Nala's expert alchemical skills. They have since returned to town, the exhaustion of your petrification behind you. 

The [[Annual Boneborn Bash]] is 21 days away. You have reason to believe *something* will occur on the 8th of Weeding related to the Occult-Infernal Invasion that has been persistent for some time now. 

With what little information you have, I must put the question to you; What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

We're mostly running from last week's notes and improv. 

### What happened?

After investigation, Nala decided to work on some alchemical preventative; over the next week, she will take 16 to make an anti-necrotic inoculant for [[Boneborn]].
