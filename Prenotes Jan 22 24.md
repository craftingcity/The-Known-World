### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had ascended from the first of many levels of the hellish entertainment citadel known as [[Kailkeep]].

From Red Rover, to Four Corners, to Pick-Up Sticks in the form of beautiful gold and ruby token-cards, the Kobold Masters of this place seem to have a fascination with simple games gone horribly wrong.

You have gathered three companions, two "Pick-Up Sticks" cards, and many wounds on your way to where you stand now; you are at the end of a hall facing a large room. This room has a set of reinforced stone doors behind significant defenses, above which a large plate of wood that has the word "MERCY" carved into it.

There is no obvious traps here, no plates or tripwires, no tubes in the walls, but rather this place seems to be a series of forward defenses for whatever "MERCY" is.

Benjamin tenses before speaking; "I don't think the Kobolds did this..."



### What does the World Know?

See [[d_ Chapter Six - Level Five; Pick-up Sticks]]

Running Mercy;
This place is desolate. There are not good times to be had. There is only survival. People make hard choices, even here. While it is safer here, people fight, and gangs raid. There are maybe 12 "guards", or 11 Marshalls and a Captain in this case, meaning that in most cases, people defend themselves or form militias when necessary.
