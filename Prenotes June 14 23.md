### Intro

When last we left our heroes... well. Most of them were dead. A fate all too common across the multiverse. For any ordinary soul, this would be the end of their story as they understand it, an eternity of similarity awaiting them until entropy takes them into nothing.

Our heroes are anything but ordinary;

You remember what happened before you were here: the curse, the wizards, the long march north with the Eladrin, the pink, the dark. The split. Daelith torn limb from core. The castle. The incredible indescribable pain that raced through your body, mind, and wholeness of being until you became here.

Here is... similar to before. The three of you are together in this room, Moses is not among you. The contents are bare, space enough for a bed, a table, a chair, and a chest, but little else. You recognize the material and placement of the items and know that you have not travelled beyond this hell.
