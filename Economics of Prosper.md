# Prosper's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The Kingdom of Prosper controls what was the [[Bandit Lords]]' territory, which is majorly farmland, and otherwise fairly forested. While it is not itself rich in resources, Prosper's relationship with Acstow allows for them to be rich in metals and other precious materials. Magic does not impact the everyday life of a citizen of Prosper. The Kingdom is a medium, less-than temperate region. It experiences mild rains.

### Bread
Rye is the common bread.

White flour is better served making other foods than bread, such as cakes and muffins and jelly pastries and the like - a mild delicacy, one might say.
### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
The forests of Prosper are populated by plump deer and pig. Cattle are kept on large ranches in cities and villages, but herding and keeping cattle farther from civilization quickly becomes impossible, leading these people to use goats instead.

#### Dairy
Both goat and cow milk and cheese are available, but cows are both harder to maintain and more desireable, so they generally cost more than the goat alternative.

#### Grain
Rye is a powerful taste. One that Prosper is used to, but Wheat makes its way into the middle-class diet too. Corn, Beans, and Potatoes are considered feed, not food.

#### Fruit
Apples and Pears are common wild trees, and make good drinks, both sweet and hard. Berries are less common, but still grow well in the region, making most more pricey than the other fruits, but Citrus reigns supreme in rarity, as it does not grow at all in this less than temperate weather.

#### Vegetable
#### Spice and Oil
#### Delicacy

### Vices
What do people do for *fun*?

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
