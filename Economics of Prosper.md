# Prosper's Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The Kingdom of Prosper controls what was the [[Bandit Lords]]' territory, which is majorly farmland, and otherwise fairly forested. While it is not itself rich in resources, Prosper's relationship with Acstow allows for them to be rich in metals and other precious materials. Magic does not impact the everyday life of a citizen of Prosper. The Kingdom is a medium, less-than temperate region. It experiences mild rains.

### Bread
Rye is the common bread.

White flour is better served making other foods than bread, such as cakes and muffins and jelly pastries and the like - a mild delicacy, one might say.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
Cattle are kept on large ranches in cities and villages, but herding and keeping cattle farther from civilization quickly becomes impossible, leading these people to use goats instead. Rabbit are also a commonly kept farm animal in this region.

The forests of Prosper are populated by deer, turkey, goose, pig and smaller animals like rabbits, raccoon, and rodents. Most game is considered commoner's meat, because it's cheap, available, and not great! Fowl and Chevron reside a step above game, but Pork and Beef are leagues of their own.

#### Dairy
Both goat and cow milk and cheese are available, but cows are both harder to maintain and more desirable, so they generally cost more than the goat alternative.

#### Grain
Rye is a powerful taste. One that Prosper is used to, but Wheat makes its way into the middle-class diet too. Nuts are not particularly common to this region, but some acorns and heart-nuts are found in this region and turned into cheap flour.

#### Fruit
Apples and Pears are common wild trees, and make good drinks, both sweet and hard. Berries are less common, but still grow well in the region, making most more pricey than the other fruits, but Citrus reigns supreme in rarity, as it does not grow at all in this less than temperate weather.

#### Vegetable
Beans, Carrots, Cabbage, Oats, Pumpkin, and Winter Squash are food of the common. People generally make many soups in this region, and while this is the cultural norm, it is also considered an intelligent and practical choice.

Animals are to be fed hay, corn, or potato. 

#### Spice and Oil
The spices grown here are from here are mostly roots such as garlic, ginger, and onion. Applesugar is cheap to make, weak in sweetening, and distinct in flavor. Most farmers can make it at home. Honey is a more expensive option, it trades being common and skilless for being actually good. Cinnamon is imported steadily from the south, and it is considered a lower-middle class commonality (and necessity, if using Applesugar).

Cow Butter is generally reserved special occasion and Goat Butter used in everyday cooking. Good Oils are expensive, as they must be transported from the City in Gold, but cheaper, a more distasteful option is available in heart-nut oil.

#### Delicacy
Because Prosper is in a powerful trade position, the available delicacies are from almost every culture in Alaturmen. Anyone wanting to put on a show would have personally traveled to collect another region's delicacy and brought it back, but your personal assistant would do only barely well.

### Vices
Brothels in Alaturmen are all represented by the Guild of 

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
