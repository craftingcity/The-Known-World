### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were still in the depths of the [[Lord's Folly#AE2. Temple to Hades]], fighting back the deity known as Orcus. After interviewing Gorrik, a cultist of Orcus, they learned that there is an incredibly important artifact here - an iron chain. Their patron, [[Alergra Barrowinch]], gave them dire warning that they should not cross this looped chain elsewise a great danger will occur.

We return to them standing at the edge of the "Soul Sludge" pool, which now contains the  decomposing corpse of Gorrik. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

We're still in the [[Lord's Folly#AE2. Temple to Hades]]. We know that they are going to want to search for the chain, so, where is it?

### What happened?
