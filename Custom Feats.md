# Conduit Caster {wip}
*Prerequisite: the Quickened Spell option of the Metamagic feature*
Your magic has become an extension of yourself, power brimming at your fingertips. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When a hostile creature exits your melee combat range, you may use your reaction and six Sorcerer Points to cast a spell of a level equal to or less your total spellcasting level divided by four (rounded down, minimum of one). You gain one point of exhaustion after using this feature.
