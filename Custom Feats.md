# Magical Conduit {wip}
*Prerequisite: the Metamagic feature*
Your magic has become a part of yourself, brimming at your fingertips. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When a hostile creature exits your melee combat range, you may use your reaction and six Sorcerer Points to cast a spell of level equal to or less than one half of your largest possible spellslot (rounded down, minimum of one). You cannot cast cantrip spells this way. You gain one point of exhaustion after using this feature.
