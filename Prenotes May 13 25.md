### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they met each other at the Araborum, a tavern within the city of [[Mossburg]]. Your objective is to deliver a package to the desk of the Captain of Enforcement within Mossburg's Garrison, home to those guards actively performing duty and prisoners of the Enforcers.
