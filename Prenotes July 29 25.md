### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had brought war to the streets of [[Mossburg]]. After delivering an explosive device to the Captain of Enforcement, and slaughtering the Captain of Imprisonment, you have significantly destabilized the structure of the [[Mossburg Enforcers]] - presenting the perfect opportunity for the surrounding Barons to pounce. You have other interests though, particularly in the cart of Amber you have agreed to deliver to the Swiftfoot Warehouse's sister-location in [[Goldfield]], west of where you are now.

### What does the World Know?

+ money (45sp)
+ 1 pipe grenade
+ ammo (8 EY-DRM & 30 LC-FPC)

##### Travelling to Goldfield
By highway and by 'backtrail' (until the highway), it'll take about 2 days without problems to reach [[Goldfield]] - likely stopping in [[Veritas Garigill]] on the first night, and pushing into the city on the second.

On the second night, before we go into town - if we haven't looked in the box, we're gonna send out some guys and say that they were always looking for them - but I really want them to open the box.

##### What's in the Box?
They are delivering the Druidic Relic 'Fixation' ([[Magical Items of Note#Fixation]]) from the Mossburg SFW to the Goldfield SFW, and eventually it will make its way into the hands of the Guild of Wizards. If the container is breached, the spirit of the hatchling will attempt to force someone to touch the stone and activate it.
