### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were as far south as any of them have been. The [[Southern Quillbuck Jungle]] has not been a hospitable place, although you have yet to suffer any major loss. Your first stop was in the small "city" of [[New Quillbuck]], where you met [[Baron Harvord]] and promptly regarded him as a potent hostile - although he did not know it.
