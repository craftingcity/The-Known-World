"Second to that; resource management. Food is easy to find here, its just hard to make sure that it isn't you. You've done a great job of that so far."

"Then come the beasties; vampire dogs, "

They made you read aloud the journal of the woman they were hunting. It was in elvish. They were Drow. They explained that they
