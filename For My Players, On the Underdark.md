Much of the Underdark is unknown to you. Throughout your life, you've heard much less than whispers of the place - the Great Below, the Shadowlands, the Dug Too Deep - but all you have heard is pain or horror. Few tales of the Underdark end well, and too many do not end.

# Travel
Travel takes much time here, as settlements are spread few and far between. 

You would walk (or ride, if you can afford it) through the rocky tunnels doused in twists, turns, shadows, and danger. 

Finding places to eat, sleep, and do your work are a task each there own in the Underdark. 

Light is your greatest ally and your greatest beacon, for worse and rarely better.

## For Amashod
The rock of this place is special; Alikiear has told you so. Your goblin companion showed you the hopefully unnecessary task of preparing and eating Wormrock, a porous near fleshy kind of stone that can be fried and seasoned with edible mushroom or fungi for an edible meal. They showed you too the brutality of Bloodstone when they ate a troglodyte's neck out in the middle of battle. 

You had heard that they were a collector of shiny things, and bought their trust and assistance with a valuable piece of jewelry.

# Fauna
The creatures here in the Underdark are nothing like the tales; they're worse. You're some tough adventurers, but in the Underdark, your flesh and bone says middle of the food chain.

When hunting, you'll be competing with other humanoids, things that eat bones, giant bugs, and horrorbeasts with big teeth!

## For Amashod
As the "Darkranger Mercenaries" of Mariul, Amicus, and Triigon said...

"Your greatest threats are Disease, Madness, and Poison. The beasties here will kill you, but many of them would just as easy feed on your corpse after you've killed yourself."

"Second to that; resource management. Food is easy to find here, its just hard to make sure that it isn't you. You've done a great job of that so far, but again, don't kill yourself."

"Then come the beasties; duergar are the worst. They'll as soon slap a chain around your neck as look at you. A lot of the Drow aren't too friendly either. Too much going on at home. Some of the wild things like Trogs, Goblin, or Bulettes you can just throw some meat at and they'll go away. Some things down here are downright mean though."

They made you read aloud the journal of the woman they were hunting. It was in elvish. They were hunting a bad woman.

# Flora
Much of the Underdark's flora is as deadly as its fauna; chocking vines and poisoned spore blasting mushrooms are of great concern.
