### Intro
You live in a world of grey, of muddy morality. You were normal, once, you had dreams of working in your hometown, staying home, staying safe. You may not understand yet, but you are different now. You are important now, more important than your dreams once were. The Fates have marked you now.

When we first meet our heroes, they do not yet know that they are heroes. They do not yet know the power they wield. These individuals will meet, under some harrowing circumstance, and will band together to form a force greater than any governance on the face of Alaturmen. At this moment, however, they are reasonably normal people with reasonably normal lives. These normal lives have led you all to commit to a simple job, acting as a caravan-guard travelling South from [[Gambleum]], along the Adventurer's Road and into [[Coalition City]].

It is the 14th of Plowing, in the 105th year. A warm summer morning greets you alongside the sounds of hustle and bustle in the streets of the city. Today, you will join a week-long operation that will end with a sack of silver in your hands at the door of the grandest city in the world.

You will meet your caravan at the [[Northstone Family Trading Company]] warehouse at the eastern edges of the city, nearby the 'Silver Snare' gamehouse & inn, and you must arrive before today's noon or the job will begin without you.

What do you do?
