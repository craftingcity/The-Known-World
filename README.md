# A Player's Guide to Alaturmen
> I live in a place of many Wonders. The lands shift before our eyes rather than behind our backs. I doubt you would believe it nearly as beautiful as our beach, but I believe this to be the truth. There are others here, the goblins as you said, but others too! It has been truly wonderful. I hope to return to you soon.

Welcome to Alaturmen. This is a fantasy world that I wrote for the purposes of being a setting in the 5th Edition of **Dungeons and Dragons**. I am a white, non-binary author, and I have tried to incorporate the classic elements of fantasy role-playing as *I* see them, having grown up on younger (and noticeably shittier) editions of the game, as well as *my* modern perspective. 

What this really means is; I'm trying to build this new fantasy setting, using **Dungeons and Dragons** as a huge mechanical and creative touchstone, with the intention of extracting the racism, sexism, gendered bullshit, etc. and dumping it out the window of the moving car that is modern table-top role-playing to the best of my ability as I write these stories.

Alaturmen, as written, is a group of four nations, a community-centralizing, "federal"-esq government, and many other smaller nation-states. When I play **D&D** I want to write the story of the adventurers who changed the world. Maybe no-one knows, and there is no fame or reward, or maybe they are heralded by children as house gods. This story usually starts small, and that *one* healing potion is the difference between life and death. As the story picks up, and your characters get larger, stronger, more influential, it becomes more about these *people*, who they are, what they do, why they do it *that way*. 

Save the inter-party romance or sacrifice everyone and destroy a great evil? Neither? Both?

What do you do? How? Why?

## Using this Document.
I built this doc as an ObsidianMD vault in the near-end of autumn of 2021. I have not finished this doc. Eventually this may turn into a campaign setting book dealio.

I these pages I describe a world that I lived in for some time; the hours I spent both at the table and at my desk are recorded here. It is a world of great magic and change. 

I present to you some central truths:

1. Alaturmen is young, [[Timeline|only a century and some change]].   
2. The [[Grand Pantheon|gods are here]], we can see them walk among us. We form them with our Faith.  
3. This place changes. Someone always does something that makes it change. It changes alone too.  
4. The [[The Planes of Existence|Planes]] are close. We can harness this, for our own power, but this truth poses a threat to us as well.  
5. People of this place are alien to you and I, but not to each other. Some people have certain traits that we may consider incredibly abnormal, but the people of Alaturmen would not.
6. We begin with peace; war happens anyways.   
7. Things happen despite your influence. This isn't just your story.  

## Building a Character
To build a character that fits into this world, I humbly request that you work with me to merge the mechanical necessities with our story-telling wishes. A part of this for me is taking what **Wizards of the Coast** says about what is true and tweaking it. A lot.

Much like in real life, the concept of "race" is a false creation on Alaturmen and its surrounding planes. The mechanical benefits that the **Player's Handbook** explicitly assigns to race sucks! I am following in the footsteps of "Ancestry and Culture; An Alternative to Race in 5e" produced by Arcanist Press and splitting those mechanical benefits between your character's heritage and their culture. 

Your character will inherit certain traits from their heritage, such as their size and speed, and will be affected by their culture by a cultural alignment and ideals (in the form of Ability Score Increases and the like).

# Heritages
Some heritages are marked with an (s.) or an (a.). This corresponds to the ability for this heritage to participate in sexual reproduction (s.) or not (a.). Those heritages that are capable of sexual reproduction are compatible for the purposes of conceiving a child; though this should not be a concern of yours, this simply informs you of some setting specific details of these fantasy people. I'm trying to be cool; this is meant to be much, much more "hey look at these cool aliens I thought up" than "these people are bad and don't fuck" because let's be very clear – everyone fucks **and** that's cool.

## Common to Alaturmen
### Goblin (s.)
Goblin are small, gangly humanoid with sharp ears and large eyes. Goblin share their origin myth with the Hobgoblin and Bugbear; the Titan [[Demogorgon]] created the Goblin-oid without purpose, keeping them as pawns and pets. They escaped [[Demogorgon]]'s influence into the greater multiverse before many of the Planes of the Multiverse. 

**Age.** You are considered fully matured at age thirteen and live to be about thirty-five. Goblin mothers birth litters of about six children.

Once you activate this heritage ability, it cannot be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.  
**Preternatural Agility.** You may take the Disengage or Hide actions as a bonus action on your turn. You gain proficiency, or expertise if you already have proficiency, in both your Armor Class and Dexterity (Stealth).

The humans of Alaturmen have no creation myth of their own - the legends claim that as Time Began upon Alaturmen, the Goblin, Elves, Dragon-kin, and Triton found them bare-naked in the fields. Humans on Alaturmen are extremely similar to the Humans of Ancient Earth, much as you and I are.

Many of the visual features of an Elf is based on their seasonal ancestry, although they all share their above human-average height, sharp ears, and powerful eyes.

**Age.** Although you are considered fully mature at about twenty-five, the traditional elven perception of "adulthood" is based on experience more than chronology. As a feature of one's coming-of-age, one would change their name from that given at birth by their parents to that name they believe they have earned. As an elf reaches the end of their satisfied life, which generally happens sometime after three hundred years of life, they Walk beyond their home plane - whatever they may find. Elven parents must be integral in the full creation process of some artistic or creative work either directly before, during, or directly after the acts of conception.

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.  
**Keen Senses.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks (The online dice service anydice.com tells me that this translates in to a mean increase of 3.82 over the 10 traditionally used for passive-style checks. Call it plus 4.).

	- **Winter.** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of the attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. You know the *Dancing Lights* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *Faerie Fire* spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the *Darkness* spell once and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.  

### Dragonborn (s.)
Common wisdom tells us that the Dragonborn were quite literally born to a humanoid and a dragon, inheriting the color of scale and affinity of element of their dragon ancestors.

**Age.** You are considered fully mature at age twenty-five and live till about one-hundred thirty. Dragonborn mothers typically birth only one child per conception, but it is possible that a mother could birth quite large litters. Dragonborn parents pass their Draconic Ancestry on to their children. When two dragonborn parents are directly responsible for conceiving children, the children are near-randomly assigned one ancestry over another.   
**Size.** Mechanically, you are considered Medium. You stand about six feet tall. You weigh about 240 pounds.  
**Speed.** Your speed is 30 feet per round.  
**Draconic Ancestry.** You are distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. Choose a type of dragon from the below list; this determines the damage and area of your breath weapon, and the type of resistance you gain.  
- **Breath Weapon.** You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. It deals damage in your choice of a 15' cone or a 30' line. When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the area must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d8 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 3d8 at 6th level, 4d8 at 11th, and 5d8 at 16th level. After using your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.  
- **Chromatic Warding.** Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can channel your draconic energies to protect yourself. For 10 minutes, you become immune to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

# Culture
Your culture bestows in you some traits and ideals that can be mechanically represented by *Ability Score Increases*, *Skills*, and *Languages*, and/or some other culturally endowed traits. I mention your culture's Alignment at the end of it's description, though I never use the word, and to be clear; This is not your assigned Alignment. You may take it if you so choose but *your* character's alignment need not reflect their culture's, but it should reflect their actions. If you decide that your character's alignment needs to shift to more accurately represent their actions, please do so, but if this is more like a character arc thing you should come talk to me.

## Nation-States of Coalition
### Kingdom of Prosper
After the [[Timeline#The Age of Beginning|Fall of Tetrimoc]], and the entrance of sentient life unto Alaturmen, a group of so-called "[[Bandit Lords]]" ruled the [[Great Northern Forests]]. Only six years later, they fall in the West, but here in the East, they ruled for another forty years. 

They fell to the Adventurer King Arthur Simonson, who now rules the Kingdom of Prosper. Since his reign, places such as [[Gambleum]], [[Janesland]], and [[Yerba]] have, as promised, Prospered, as well have the smaller settlements under his influence. He extends his reach far into the northwest, reaching into what's left of the [[Great Northern Forests]] at risk of angering the [[Blood Clans]] at these borders.

The state-mandated-education in Prosper teaches children to read and write, as well as promoting personal hardiness and community focus; It is an honor to know your neighbor, and it is a pleasure to host them in your home. The people of Prosper have a history of near-virtuous violence, and they raise their children to defend themselves. The culture of Prosper is one of Lawful Goodness; their system of government is good and kind, and they are bound to their fellows through the experience of life.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.   
**Languages.** You know at least these two languages; [[King's Common (language)]] and [[Goblin (language)]].  
**Skills.** You are proficient in Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival), and one set of tools of your choice.  
**Martial Discipline.** You are proficient with light and medium armors, as well as all basic and martial weapons. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.  

### Church of the White Flame
The Church of the White Flame rose from the ashes of the North-West – after the [[Great Fires]] immolated this place people flocked to their new deity. Quickly, a caste-theocracy formed around **[[Its Greatness|The Holy Flame]]** and **It**'s wishes. 

The few who claim to have Spoken with [[Its Greatness]] claim the top of this system, and those who are fiercely loyal (and properly propagandized) become Firstchurch or Tendered. The common folk are given the name Patrons, and those below them – the slaves or those otherwise untouched by the [[Its Greatness|White Flame]] – are called Unseen or, in the case of an enemy, Undesirable.

The culture of the Church is one of Lawful Evil; violence is necessary to do what **It** wills, and thus is virtuous, and people of this church are comfortable with the understanding that *some people simply are not worth as much as others*.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Wisdom increases by 1.  
**Languages.** You know at least two languages; [[High Common (language)]] and [[Modern Elven (language)]].  
**Skills.** You are proficient in Intelligence (Religion), Wisdom (Survival), and one set of tools of your choice.  
**Mental Discipline.** You have resistance to psychic damage. You have advantage on all Wisdom saving throws.  

### Golden City
When [[Tetrimoc]] fell to the world, and sentience was born unto Alaturmen, he made his lair in [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]], boring deep into the desert. The people of these Deserts came to him here and built him, and themselves, a beautiful city of gold and sand. Those who live in the Golden City are of two kinds; with power and without. These two groups fight to take what the other has every day in this place, through law *and* chaos. Many who live here revere [[Tetrimoc]], and those who don't at least respect him – the city is made in his home after all. 

For as long as people have been here, they have been protected by [[Tetrimoc]], and though the Golden Light, Planeblood, [[Tetrimoc]] the Progenitor himself has not been seen for about a dozen years, the people of the Golden city take comfort in High Ambassador [[Venclaw]]'s claims that he is in constant communication with the Dragon of the Golden City. 

The culture of the Golden City is one of True Neutrality; while there are laws here, they benefit those in power much more than those out of power, and they are enforced *much more* than they are respected. Crime is a necessary component of the City's economy, and day-to-day survival for many.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.  
**Languages.** You know at least these two languages; [[Desertspeech (language)]] and [[Draconic (language)]].  
**Skills.** You are proficient in Intelligence (History), Charisma (Persuasion), and one set of tools of your choice.  
**Desert Proficiency.** You gain advantage on Dexterity (Initiative) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks while you are in a desert.  

### Democratic Combine of Peoples
The peoples of the DCP are ruled by their Barons, nearly all of whom fight among themselves when the Combine as a whole is not under threat. These barons find use for **all** who live within their domain. The culture of the DCP is one of Chaotic Good; their ideology can be summarized by the phrase "no-one hurts my sibling but me".

**My Baron Can Beat Up Your Baron.** You gain either one feat of your choice or an Ability score of your choice increases by 2.
**Languages.** You know at least these two languages; [[Swampish (language)]] and [[Aquarian (language)]].

## Non-Coalition Entities
### Dwarven Kingdoms

In addition, whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of any architectural construction, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.  

### Cenva Minyo
[[Cenva Minyo]] is an elvish phrase that can be understood as "*for the hatred of fire, we are home here*". This group was formed in direct opposition to [[Its Greatness|The Great White Flame]] and the [[Great Fires]], and the commoner wishes for nothing more than to smite the [[Its Greatness|White Flame]] from reality. For now, these people bide their time making fabrics in the forest south of the [[Actstow Hills]]. The culture of Cenva Minyo is one of True Neutrality - nothing is worth more than an end to the Flame.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. 
**Languages.** You know at least these two languages; [[Modern Elven (language)]] and [[Dwarven (language)]].

You gain proficiency with one kind of artisan’s tools of your choice. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen tool proficiency. 

### Blood-Hobgoblin Clans
The [[Blood Clans]] are a region of [[Northeastern Central]] [[Alaturmen]]. The people who live here are psuedo-nomatic, often traveling between permanent structures though out the seasons, and always ready to defend themselves. The culture of these people is one of Lawful Neutrality, holding themselves and their clan-mates to their [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact|Blood Pact]].

### Desert Outlanders
Groups of cannibalistic nomads and honorable thieves stalk [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]] in search of necessary supplies that are far too rare in the Outlands. The culture of these people is one of True Neutrality, they are forced to do what they must to survive, although many find good and hope in community.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Constitution score increases by 1.  
**Languages.** You know at least these two languages; [[Desertspeech (language)]] and your choice of [[Thieves Cant (language)]] or [[Infernal (language)]].  
**Skills.** You are proficient in Wisdom (Survival), Wisdom (Animal Handling), and one set of tools of your choice.  
**Fortune of the Many.** If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses you finish a long rest.  

## Extraplanar
You are from beyond Alaturmen, which is not all too uncommon in this realm, but nonetheless I cannot list all cultures in the multiverse. 

Add 1 to two Ability scores of your choice, learn two languages of your choice, and become proficient in two skills and one tool of your choice. If you'd like a special feature related to your culture, lets talk about it, but otherwise, please take a feat of your choice.

# Ex-Occupation
While your specific background is likely tied deeply to your character's Culture and Heritage, as well as our ideas about your charachter's story, what the **Player's Handbook** calls background I would like to call your character's ex-occupation. 

> Once, I was an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee. I was in the military before, during the Invasion of Orcus, and my training served me well in my days of glory. They only keep me on watch these days. Mind if I bum a joint?
> \- A guard I just made up

That guard may have been an adventurer for some time, but they were never on the star-studded cast of a **Dungeons and Dragons** campaign, like your character will be. Something made your character switch paths, starting them into a life of adventure ending in power or death.

# Exploring Alaturmen
### The World is Young
In the Time before Time, many things happened at once and forever.

The Three Fates crafted the fabric of reality, known as the Weave, and from it many beings became; the [[Immortal Dragons]], the [[Jabbawok]], the [[All-Father Annam]], [[Asmodeus]], and [[Demogorgon]].

In the planes that were before time was, the [[Ceilie Courts]]' [[Eladrin Specifics|Eladrin]] made their progeny; ***onnonyamile***; *child of my parent*; the [[Elven Specifics|Elves]]. It was the Eladrin's claim that the Elves were the true heirs of Alaturmen, that it was made for *their* children, and this was what they told their children.

Quickly, these claims had no power, for **mortality** would claim all in Alaturmen, pardoning only its [[Grand Pantheon|Gods]], and the people who came to be came to be together.

### About Trade
Most people use barter to trade for resources, but coin and merchant bar is acceptable currency nearly anywhere, if not for their full value. The Kingdom of Prosper has a large treasury, and has spread coin around the world, making theirs the dominant currency, but each of the "nations" of the world mint their own coin.

See [[Currency of Alaturmen]] for more details.

### About Work
The most common working job is that of the Farmer. The second most common is that of the Defender. The third, the Plunderer. People of the realm keep an open mind for the most part. Most fear the many dangerous monsters that plague the lands, and seek protection from those powers that be. They want peace and security.

### About Technology
The people of the world have [[The Worldwide Calendar Systems|different names]] for the days of the week and months of the year, but they all use a 7 day-week, 4 week-month, and 12 month-year.

The most common languages spoken are [[Desertspeech (language)]], [[High Common (language)]], [[King's Common (language)]], and [[Swampish (language)]]. They are all born of the languages of the humans mixed with great influence from the historical languages of the dragonborn, elves, goblin, and triton respectively.

Most of [[Alaturmen]] has technology only barely more advanced than that which one would imagine a 1600s-peasant might have access to, and missing some key developments such as gunpowder or printing. Magic is a rarity, and a closely protected influence on the world of [[Alaturmen]].

### About Power
The quickest path to power is by the [[How the Weave becomes Magic|manipulation of the Weave]]; magic. Mages are respected and often feared, as they have immense power. Items enchanted and spellbound are rare; hard to create, harder to find. Few exist outside of hoards of dragons and mages.

Secondarily, many gain power by learning from their elders, peers, and the reading-materials of the past. Three of four people develop the ability to read.

Tertiarily, of course, many people gain power through some physical force; more weaponry, people, or strength.

#### About Faith
Faith holds a special kind of power; that of the many, the bonded in ideal, the togetherness that forms a [[Grand Pantheon|God]] – or feeds a power of such a caliber. People of the multiverse are all born into their world with a Soul, the densest form of Faith their is; Faith in Life.

#### About Punishment
Exile or Execution are common punishments for serious crimes such as treason or murder. Fines or Imprisonment are common for minor crimes, such as swashbucklery, skulldugery or dissent.

Many cultures have unique forms of punishment and unique crimes. A culture's justification for punishment is also often unique, be it a contract, ideal, or some other broken bond.

### The Wildlands
At the edges of civilization, the Wildlands extend beyond Alaturmen and into someplace more Ethereal. The landscape beyond changes and shifts, as does the line that separates Alaturmen from the lands beyond.

Those people who travel too far into the forest or the desert find themselves quickly lost and cast beyond [[Alaturmen]] into untoward horrors or new homes.
