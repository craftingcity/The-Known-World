Welcome to Alaturmen!

This world is young, barely a century has passed since time has begun to be recorded. This is a world of myth, story, and song. This is a world of brutal order and revered chaos. This is a world of people, with relationships, and feelings, and continuity. You have a chance to write your name on the record of history every day. Most do not have this blessing.

What is beyond our world is unknown to most. We call the edges of our known world 'The Wildlands', a borderland, where few dare travel, and fewer succeed to return. If one can survive, they could travel on foot from our plane unto any other.

The world we do know and understand is occupied primarily by four major states - The Church of the White Flame, The Kingdom of Prosper, the Democratic Combine of Peoples, and the Deserts of Tetrimoc - all of whom gather under the Coalition, which acts as an incredibly loose federal system.
