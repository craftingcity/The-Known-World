# A Player's Guide to Alaturmen
> I live in a place of many Wonders. The lands shift before our eyes rather than behind our backs. I doubt you would believe it nearly as beautiful as our beach, but I believe this to be the truth. There are others here, the goblins as you said, but others too! It has been truly wonderful. I hope to return to you soon.

Welcome to Alaturmen. This is a fantasy world that I wrote for the purposes of being a setting in the 5th Edition of **Dungeons and Dragons**. I am a white, non-binary author, and I have tried to incorporate the classic elements of fantasy role-playing as *I* see them, having grown up on younger (and noticeably shittier) editions of the game, as well as *my* modern perspective. What this really means is; I'm trying to build this new fantasy setting, using **Dungeons and Dragons** as a huge mechanical and creative touchstone, with the full intention of juicing the racism and sexism out the window of the moving car that is modern table-top role-playing.

Alaturmen, as written, is a group of four nations, a community-centralizing, "federal"-esq government, and many other smaller nation-states. When I play **D&D** I want to write the story of the adventurers who changed the world. Maybe no-one knows, and there is no fame or reward, or maybe they are heralded by children as house gods. This story usually starts small, and that *one* healing potion is the difference between life and death. As the story picks up, and your characters get larger, stronger, more influential, it becomes more about these *people*, who they are, what they do, why they do it *that way*. Saving the inter-party romance or sacrificing everyone and destroying a great evil? 

## Using this Document.
I built this doc as an ObsidianMD vault in the near-end of autumn of 2021. I have not finished this doc. Eventually this may turn into a campaign setting book dealio.

I these pages I describe a world that I lived in for some time; the hours I spent both at the table and at my desk are recorded here. It is a world of great magic and change. 

I present to you some central truths;

1. Alaturmen is young, [[Timeline|only a century and some change]]. 
2. The [[Grand Pantheon|gods are here]], we can see them walk among us. We form them with our Faith.
3. This place changes. Someone always does something that makes it change. It changes alone too.
4. The [[The Planes of Existence|Planes]] are leaking in. This means we get to make more, but it also means that people have to stop it leaking to far.
5. People in this place simply become here. Sometimes they are born, sometimes they are carved. Everyone's story is different. 
6. We begin with peace; war happens anyways.
7. Things happen despite your influence. This isn't just your story.

## Building a Character
To build a character that fits into this world, I humbly request that you work with me to merge the mechanical necessities with our story-telling wishes. A part of this for me is taking what **Wizards of the Coast** says about what is true and tweaking it. A lot.

Much like in real life, the concept of "race" is false on Alaturmen, and the surrounding planes. The mechanical benefits that the **Player's Handbook** assigns explicitly to race sucks! I am following in the footsteps of "Ancestry and Culture; An Alternative to Race in 5e" produced by Arcanist Press and splitting those mechanical benefits between your character's heritage and their culture. 

Your character will inherit certain traits from their heritage, such as their size and speed, and will be affected by their culture by a cultural alignment and ideals (as the form of Ability Score Increases).

### Heritages
Some heritages are marked with an (s.) or an (a.). This corresponds to the ability for this heritage to participate in sexual reproduction (s.) or not (a.). Those heritages that are capable of sexual reproduction are compatible for the purposes of conceiving a child; though this should not be a concern of yours, this simply informs you of some setting specific details of these fantasy people. I'm trying to be cool; this is meant to be much, much more "hey look at these cool aliens i thought up" than "these people are bad".

**Age.** Although you are considered fully mature at about twenty-five, the traditional elven perception of "adulthood" is based worldly experience more than physicality. Additionally, one would change their name from that given at birth by their parents to that name they believe they have earned.

When you reach 5th level, you can cast the *Darkness* spell once and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

Dragonborn mothers typically birth only one child per conception, but it is possible that a mother could birth quite large litters.

When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the area must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d8 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 3d8 at 6th level, 4d8 at 11th, and 5d8 at 16th level. After using your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

### Ex-Occupation
While your specific background is likely tied deeply to your character's Culture and Heritage, as well as our ideas about your charachter's story, what the **Player's Handbook** calls background I would like to call your character's ex-occupation. 

> Once, I was an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee. I was in the military before, during the Invasion of Orcus, and my training served me well in my days of glory. They only keep me on watch these days. Bum a cig?
> \- A guard I just made up

That guard may have been an adventurer for some time, but they were never on the star-studded cast of a **Dungeons and Dragons** campaign, like your character will be. Something made your character switch paths, starting them into a life of adventure ending in power or death.

## Exploring Alaturmen
### Central Alaturmen's Features
#### The World is Young
In the Time before Time, many things happened at once and forever.

The Three Fates crafted the fabric of reality, known as the Weave, and from it many beings became; the [[Immortal Dragons]], the [[Jabbawok]], the [[All-Father Annam]], [[Asmodeus]], and [[Demogorgon]].

In the planes that were before time was, the [[Ceilie Courts]]' [[Eladrin Specifics|Eladrin]] made their progeny; ***onnonyamile***; *child of my parent*; the [[Elven Specifics|Elves]]. It was the Eladrin's claim that the Elves were the true heirs of Alaturmen, that it was made for *their* children, and this was what they told their children.

Quickly, these claims had no power, for **mortality** would claim all in Alaturmen, pardoning only its [[Grand Pantheon|Gods]], and the people who came to be came to be *together*.

#### About Our People
Most people use barter to trade for resources, as most people do not carry minted coin, but coin and merchant bar is acceptable currency nearly anywhere. The Kingdom of Prosper has a large treasury, and has spread coin around the world, making theirs the dominant currency, but each of the "nations" of the world mint their own coin.

The most common working job is that of the Farmer. The second most common is that of the Defender. The third, the Plunderer. People of the realm keep an open mind for the most part. Most fear the many dangerous monsters that plague the lands, and seek protection from those powers that be. They want peace and security.

The people of the world have [[The Worldwide Calendar Systems|different names]] for the days of the week and months of the year, but they all use a 7 day-week, 4 week-month, and 12 month-year.

The most common languages spoken are [[Desertspeech (language)]], [[High Common (language)]], [[King's Common (language)]], and [[Swampish (language)]]. They are all born of the languages of the humans mixed with great influence from the historical languages of the dragonborn, elves, goblin, and triton respectively.

Most of [[Alaturmen]] has technology only barely more advanced than that which one would imagine a 1600s-peasant might have access to, and missing some key developments such as gunpowder or printing. Magic is a rarity, and a closely protected influence on the world of [[Alaturmen]].

#### About Power
The quickest path to power is by the [[How the Weave becomes Magic|manipulation of the Weave]]; magic. Mages are respected and often feared, as they have immense power. Items enchanted and spellbound are rare; hard to create, harder to find. Few exist outside of hoards of dragons and mages.

Secondarily, many gain power by learning from their elders, peers, and the reading-materials of the past. Three of four people develop the ability to read.

Tertiarily, of course, many people gain power through some physical force; more weaponry, people, or strength.

##### About Faith
Faith holds a special kind of power; that of the many, the bonded in ideal, the togetherness that forms a [[Grand Pantheon|God]] – or feeds a power of such a caliber. People of the multiverse are all born into their world with a Soul, the densest form of Faith their is; Faith in Life.

#### About Punishment
Exile or Execution are common punishments for serious crimes such as treason or murder. Fines or Imprisonment are common for minor crimes, such as swashbucklry, skulldugery or dissent.

Many cultures have unique forms of punishment and unique crimes. A culture's justification for punishment is also often unique, be it a contract, ideal, or some other broken bond.
