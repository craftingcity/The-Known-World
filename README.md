# Using this Doc
I built this doc as an ObsidianMD vault in the near-end of autumn of 2021. I have not finished this doc. 

I these pages I describe a world that I lived in for some time; the hours I spent both at the table and at my desk are recorded here. It is a world of great magic and change. 
1. For now it is young, [[Prime Timeline|only a century and some change]]. 
2. The [[The Pantheon|gods are here]], we can see them walk among us.
3. This place changes. Someone always does something that makes it change.
4. The [[The Planes of Existence|Planes]] are leaking in. This means we get to make more, but it also means that people want to stop it.
5. People in this place simply become here. Sometimes they are born, sometimes they are carved. Everyone's story is different.
6. We start with peace; war ha
