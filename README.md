# A Player's Guide to Alaturmen
> I live in a place of many Wonders. The lands shift before our eyes rather than behind our backs. I doubt you would believe it nearly as beautiful as our beach, but I believe this to be the truth. There are others here, the goblins as you said, but others too! It has been truly wonderful. I hope to return to you soon.

## Using this Document.
I built this doc as an ObsidianMD vault in the near-end of autumn of 2021. I have not finished this doc. Eventually this may turn into a campaign setting book dealio.

I these pages I describe a world that I lived in for some time; the hours I spent both at the table and at my desk are recorded here. It is a world of great magic and change. 

I present to you some central truths;

1. Alaturmen is young, [[Timeline|only a century and some change]]. 
2. The [[Grand Pantheon|gods are here]], we can see them walk among us. We form them with our Faith.
3. This place changes. Someone always does something that makes it change. It changes alone too.
4. The [[The Planes of Existence|Planes]] are leaking in. This means we get to make more, but it also means that people have to stop it leaking to far.
5. People in this place simply become here. Sometimes they are born, sometimes they are carved. Everyone's story is different. This is good and cool.
6. We begin with peace; war happens anyways.
7. Things happen despite your influence. This isn't just your story.

## Building a Character
To build a character that fits into this world, I humbly request that you work with me to merge the mechanical necessities with our story-telling wishes. A part of this for me is taking what **Wizards of the Coast** says about what is true and tweaking it. A lot.

Much like in real life, the concept of "race" is false on Alaturmen, and the surrounding planes. The mechanical benefits that the **Player's Handbook** assigns explicitly to race sucks! I am following in the footsteps of "Ancestry and Culture; An Alternative to Race in 5e" produced by Arcanist Press and splitting those mechanical benefits between your character's heritage and their culture. 

### Heritage
#### Sexually Reproducing
##### And Multi-Drift Compatible!
#### Asexually Reproducing
### Culture
### Ex-Occupation
While your specific background is likely tied deeply to your character's Culture and Heritage, as well as our ideas about your charachter's story, what the **Player's Handbook** calls background I would like to call your character's ex-occupation. 

> Once, I was an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee. I was in the military before, during the Invasion of Orcus, and my training served me well in my days of glory. They only keep me on watch these days. Bum a cig?
> \- A guard I just made up

That guard may have been an adventurer for some time, but they were never on the star-studded cast of a **Dungeons and Dragons** campaign, like your character will be. Something made your character switch paths, starting them into a life of adventure ending in power or death.

#### Personality
##### Alignment
##### Flaws
##### Ideals
##### Bonds
#### Occupation
There are two kinds of people in this world; NPCs and PCs. What differentiates a PC from an NPC is a blurry line in the fiction of our world, but most "adventurers" did something before they started taking quests from wealthy patrons or delving into ruins in seek of ancient power. So I put to you the player, what did your character do with their life before they began to walk to the tavern and met their adventuring party?

## Exploring Alaturmen
### Central Alaturmen's Features
#### The World is Young
In the Time before Time, many things happened at once and forever.

The Three Fates crafted the fabric of reality, known as the Weave, and from it many beings became; the [[Immortal Dragons]], the [[Jabbawok]], the [[All-Father Annam]], [[Asmodeus]], and [[Demogorgon]].

In the planes that were before time was, the [[Ceilie Courts]]' [[Eladrin Specifics|Eladrin]] made their progeny; ***onnonyamile***; *child of my parent*; the [[Elven Specifics|Elves]]. It was the Eladrin's claim that the Elves were the true heirs of Alaturmen, that it was made for *their* children, and this was what they told their children.

Quickly, these claims had no power, for **mortality** would claim all in Alaturmen, pardoning only its Gods, and the people who came to be came to be *together*.

#### About Our People
Most people use barter to trade for resources, as most people do not carry minted coin, but coin and merchant bar is acceptable currency nearly anywhere. The Kingdom of Prosper has a large treasury, and has spread coin around the world, making theirs the dominant currency, but each of the "nations" of the world mint their own coin.

The most common working job is that of the Farmer. The second most common is that of the Defender. The third, the Plunderer. People of the realm keep an open mind for the most part. Most fear the many dangerous monsters that plague the lands, and seek protection from those powers that be. They want peace and security.

The people of the world have [[The Worldwide Calendar Systems|different names]] for the days of the week and months of the year, but they all use a 7 day-week, 4 week-month, and 12 month-year.

The most common languages spoken are [[Desertspeech (language)]], [[High Common (language)]], [[King's Common (language)]], and [[Swampish (language)]]. They are all born of the languages of the humans mixed with great influence from the historical languages of the dragons, elves, goblin, and triton respectively.

Most of [[Alaturmen]] has technology only barely more advanced than that which one would imagine a 1600s-peasant might have access to, and missing some key developments such as gunpowder or printing. Magic is a rarity, and a closely protected influence on the world of [[Alaturmen]].

#### About Power
The quickest path to power is by the [[How the Weave becomes Magic|manipulation of the Weave]]; magic. Mages are respected and often feared, as they have immense power. Items enchanted and spellbound are rare; hard to create, harder to find. Few exist outside of hoards of dragons and mages.

Secondarily, many gain power by learning from their elders, peers, and the reading-materials of the past. Three of four people develop the ability to read.

Tertiarily, of course, many people gain power through some physical force; more weaponry, people, or strength.

Faith holds a special kind of power; that of the many, the bonded in ideal, the togetherness that forms a God â€“ or feeds a power of such a caliber.

#### About Punishment
Exile or Execution are common punishments for serious crimes such as treason or murder. Fines or Imprisonment are common for minor crimes, such as swashbucklry, skulldugery or dissent.

Many cultures have unique forms of punishment and unique crimes. A culture's justification for punishment is also often unique, be it a contract, ideal, or some other broken bond.
