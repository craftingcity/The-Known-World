### Intro

This is the story of an unlikely pair. Starting on a shifting foot, a chance meeting grows and evolves into a lifelong bond.

We begin our tale with the younger of the two - an aspiring adventurer and lorekeeper by the name of Oliver. He works in the big city, on the third floor of an office building in the Ruby Ward, at a desk with an overwhelming amount of files to review, approve, and file.

Review. Approve. File...

Review. Approve. File...

Review. Approve. File...

Review... Huh. This one is different. It's addressed to you.

```

	Clerk Oliver,

	You have been recommended to me by your superiors in regards to a small task. I have been notified that the Mossburg Great Vault has not been audited by the Guild of Wizards within the last 18 months, and is due for one. 
	You have been granted a task-leave of 7 days for your position beginning end-of-day today, the fourth day of the 106th Harvest for this operation; You and an assigned Handler will travel into Mossburg and discretely attempt to detect and extract a valueable lockbox of your choice held by the Mossburg Great Vault. Until you are under direct suspision, do not reveal your assosiation with the Guilds or with myself. Please discretely gather and deliver the lockbox unto your Handler. 
	At this time, your operation is concluded, and you may return to work with the knowledge that you were participating in regulated, lawful, and approved Guild activity.

	May the Gods shine upon your journey,
	Bond Calvin Ameex

```

A break? To do something important? Your life of adventure awaits!

### What does the World Know?

The Mossburg Great Vault is a public bank operated by Calvin Ameex under the approval of the [[Baron Vannis]].

Two stories and a basement - an office, public floor, and the vault - leave little to be desired by its 2,400 patrons. There are 12 employees at the bank, and the son of the manager - Binx Ameex. There are 4 stationed Enforcers, two on the first floor, two at the vault.

The vault is locked to a bio-chanted key and a 6" lead lining around a 1' mild-steel casing.

There are over 300 registered and filled personal lockboxes at MGV, of which ~3 are of the recently deceased;

```
JAMES, Frank - 6+ years of registry, "Business Profits"
	- 7442sp
	- a carved ivory knight with the phrase 'Fight for Honor, Ride the Road' inscribed on the base.
	- identification documents for a "Alabaster Hanz" of the Church of the White Flame

KILLFISH, The - 1+ years of registry, "Storage"
	- 1138sp
	- 6 bars of Mythril
