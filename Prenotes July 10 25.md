### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had breached the first containing wall surrounding the [[Kohnstamm]] city-area, killing a patrolling squad along the way, and now preparing for their treck forward towards the city itself. Your investigations of [[Otto Malkovich]] have led you to believe he is working somewhere in the city on an "experimental genetics" project, under forceful authority of the Ideology Correction Corps, and your recent encounter with the standing guards reinforce your understanding that this is a city at war - prepared against invasions such as the one you are attempting to facilitate. With that understanding in mind, I will ask, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?
#### Force
This is the classic - we get to run through a lot of combat, but it might be a slog. We can minimize this by trading these combats for immediate progress and reward, and allowing these Heroes their unusual, war-breaking feats. Obviously not all the army can come fight, or would know to - logistics and communication win battles, and our Heroes are their own logistics engines, so they do just get to keep moving around, making opposing communication less useful
#### Coercion
We force someone into doing what we want, like bringing us all into the city under a cart or something. This might just work out, based on the devices they are utilizing and their execution and such, but it would at least get them to the gates of [[Kohnstamm]] itself, and then turn to Force.
#### Deception
We somehow lie our way in. This would be the most difficult option, in my opinion, but I won't throw a fit if they work it out - their Orc is technically a Patron, and would be under the typical legal protections, and otherwise they are all legal, but without paperwork. Slipping through and around will be the best way this works out, having a direct confrontation where they have to provide some kind of documentation would be potentially disastrous - they have no official reason to be travelling to and from the city during wartime, which is failure of responsibility to the state, a grievous crime.

### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
