### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they had travelled alongside water merchants towards the [[Alvalini River]]] and [[Barthalamule]]. After a conflict involving wild Wurms, the party departed the one surviving water merchant in the small town of [[Abricadabrin]]. After resting, the party attempted to stealthily remove themselves from the town - but were unsuccessful - as they are halted by one [[Qiell Tilemundon]].
