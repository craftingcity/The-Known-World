### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had great success in their trip to [[Kohnstamm]], where they fought their way through the city's Experimental Genetics Facility to find [[Otto Malkovich]]. After quickly dispatching the Doctor, and disposing of the orcish subjects, the party cleared the rest of the building and escaped the city with a small bounty of information. Items of note include the Experimental Genetics Collections, volumes one through three, the life-work of Nikolai's parents, and a foreboding drawing of a black deer titled "it's everywhere".

Upon their return to their home in [[Coalition City]], the party's homekeeper-alchemist [[Anita Rewch]] presented their newly furnished abode, and over a well-earned home dinner, she spoke of her research being 'experimentally viable'. Today is the 25th of Harvest, in the 106th year. She's ready.
