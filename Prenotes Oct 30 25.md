### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had great success in their trip to [[Kohnstamm]], where they fought their way through the city's Experimental Genetics Facility to find [[Otto Malkovich]]. After quickly dispatching the Doctor, and disposing of the orcish subjects, the party cleared the rest of the building and escaped the city with a small bounty of information. Items of note include the Experimental Genetics Collections, volumes one through three, the life-work of Nikolai's parents, and a foreboding drawing of a black deer.

Upon their return to their home in [[Coalition City]], the party's homekeeper-alchemist [[Anita Rewch]] presented their newly furnished abode, and over a well-earned home dinner, she spoke of her research being 'experimentally viable'. Today is the 25th of Harvest, in the 106th year. She's ready. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
#### Anita, *Display Faith*, & the Notadeer
Anita Rewch has created a new ritual spell, *display faith*. She plans on performing it for the first time on Saorsia, in an attempt to identify what extraplanar entity she had encountered in her past. 

When performed, *display faith* will create a series of illusory orbs surrounding the target. These orbs will be of various sizes, representing the portion of faith being gathered by a given entity. When *identified*, more information regarding who/what the faith is gathered by can be gained.

#### Roan & Slimknives Missions
Roan is going to have to stick around in town for a while, they need to keep their reputation in the Slimknives. He'll do solo missions if the party is uninterested in the money, but there are some things we would be able to do together;
	- "Fire Sale"
	- "Termination"
	- "Reposession"
	- "Estate Sale"

#### The Fallen watches...
Agents of the Fallen are watching the party. They have been tailed since [[Kohnstamm]], and are within the sights of the hivemind - our goal is the elimination of Zipper, and the rest of the party will be collateral damage.

Plan A; *Hired Killers*. Unlikely to succeed, low resource investment. Always a good first choice.
Plan B; *Cart Bomb* May succeed, middling resource investment. Not my favorite.
Plan C; *Return to the Old* High success rate, high resource investment. If they don't die out there, we'll do it ourselves.

### What happened?

22 gave the EGF yearbooks to Anita to comb through and contextualize.
Niko wants to research ways to kill Notadeer, learn Infernal, and comb through his parents research.
Soarsia wants to find and talk to a demonologist, and eventually find a dragon.

We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
