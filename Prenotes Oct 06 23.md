### Intro

When last we left our heroes, the world believed that they were spending an abnormal amount of time in their room at the Silver Unicorn Inn here in the Wheel Ward of [[Coalition City]]. 

We know, however, that they were not truly within that room. Perhaps conceptually, and it was true that they would return to the world from this place, but in reality, they were all within a bag. A bag of many rooms. 

### What does the World Know?

Taking a riverboat typically costs 2 silver per crate/barrel or 3 silver per person per day. Breenabell will be able to get a free ride if she really wants it.
