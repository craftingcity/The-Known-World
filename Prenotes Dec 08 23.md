### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they met two new companions - a Gnoll fighter by the name of Giovani two introduced themselves as agents of the Barons Glask and Avory respectively, and have explained that they are to act as an escort to Daelith during her travel to the [[Westlick Mossland]]. 

We return to the party after they have wiped their blades clean of the blood of their fallen foes, and they gather their packs for travel. I will put the question to you, who leads and what route do we take?

Today's ingame date is the 27th of Resowing, and the party is travelling from between [[Amyl Dother]] and [[Hitharu]]. Their current plan is to travel north-north-east until they pass the jungle, then south into their final destination.

the north-east-south route will get everyone to [[Beacon]] on the 5th day.
a cut through the jungle will get everyone to Beacon on the 4th day of travel, but would be more dangerous. I will advise them based on their leaders survival and their parties' stealth abilities.

If Daelith puts no fight, and Avory takes her easy then we replace her with Blade is Sharp and keep the party moving - sending them north-west into [[The Old|Minyostalma's Ruins]] would be wonderful.

We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
