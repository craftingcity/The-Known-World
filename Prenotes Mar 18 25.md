You catch your breath, and gather your wits; you've entered some sort of connecting art hall - four figures of dwarven stature are carved statues of stone in the corners of this room, each wearing large bulky platemail, and a pair of paintings flanking a central column, one displaying a wealth of gold, jewels, and coinage, and the other being a rather realistic depiction the Deakred Range viewed somewhere on the southern half of the world.
