### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were deep underground. Below the soft soil of the world you know, another, harder world survives. You are looking towards a part of that world that failed to do so - Deepreach, a once proud tale of persistence and mutual benefit turned sour as communication broke down before ceasing entirely, leaving only the whisper of speculation to present its explanations; famine, plague, infighting, or invasion are all reasonable theories you've heard in your short time here. 

After working with Minora, she suggested that you would be deeply owed if you were to return from Deepreach with actionable knowledge regarding its fall. Since then, you have descended further than you have gone before, into a tunnel that ended at a pair of large darksteel doors.

You arrived in style, kicking in the door and slaying the Illithid residing in this hall. You catch your breath, and gather your wits; you've entered some sort of connecting art hall - four figures of dwarven stature are carved statues of stone in the corners of this room, each wearing large bulky platemail, and a pair of paintings flanking a central column, one displaying a wealth of gold, jewels, and coinage, and the other being a rather realistic depiction the Deakred Range viewed somewhere on the southern half of the world.

Three doors lead to halls from this room, one of which you see is still flung open by a retreated Illithid. The other two stand closed. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
Everything goes down into the City, eventually, so they get to look at my cool goopis city and my Last of Us / Alien style badguys rip.
