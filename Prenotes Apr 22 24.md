### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had entered the mysterious and dangerous ruins of the ancient empire that never was in search of a lost relative. With little information and as much courage as you could muster, you have decided to continue deeper into the Old, where you hope to find Romeo alive and well.

You have met friendly faces in this place known as "the Rookie Village", where you met a shrewd goliath named [[Ondo]], who acted as the Village's merchant and lifeline to the outside. You acquired information, equipment, and a direction, and you now prepare to depart the Rookie Village for a place known as "the Factory", the first stop on your quarry's trail.

### What does the World Know?

They must be weary of navigating past both Anomalies and hostile Scavs as they exit the Haven into the Broken Swamps, and even moreso when they do enter Factory from there; one of the few major conflict sites within the Old. The Mercs are still winning. 

When they do reach the Factory, they can find the well looted corpse of Simone, which has only been left with her final words ([[Romeo's Journal (and Others)]], and a Durandurm round to the base of her skull. 

### What happened?
They've made it to the Factory and talked with the Mercs, though they don't know that name. They hired a squad to take them through the Base.

The following is the Squad of Mercs they went with;
	- "Bubble", Triton, Master
	- "Screw", Gnoll, Professional
	- "Georgie", Human, Professional
	- "Astro", Elf, Professional
	- "Dom", Human, Experienced
	- "Locus", Elf, Experienced

As they travelled through the Factory, they found a group of WFM scavenging, 8 visible, but this is a full Patrol (24, 4x6);
