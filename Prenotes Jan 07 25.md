### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had spoken with the Lost Mercenary 'Ayoyt' and discovered to what extent the quarantine extends around the Mining Colonies. After some investigation, it was decided that you would be re-entering the caverns beneath [[Mountain Hall]] in an attempt to finally put together some information regarding the happenstance of your gathering.

As you descend, you hear the quiet jingle of your void-tie chains, and the surrounding light begins to dim before eventually ceasing truly. Your vision is greyscaled now - you all can see in the dark, but not very well - you see outlines of the stone and your companions around you.

You have descended for hours. Your ears feel stuffed and clogged by the change in pressure down here, but eventually, the lowest among you feel stone grab your feet as you finally land. You're in a crossroads - four natural tunnels lead away from this stone chamber you have landed in. 

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

The pathways are labeled in [[Montal (language)]] & [[Giant (language)]] - North is [[Grazing Fields]], East is [[Forgehome]] but paths are fucked, South is [[Growth Heart]], West is [[Fungal Forests]]. A repeating phrase warns the reader they are entering a new place.
