### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they were in the capital of the world, [[Coalition City]], on a hunt for information. They specifically have been on the trail of the so-called "black-blood curse" that affected a group of Gnoll pit-fighters in [[Yerba]], its connection to the "great hum" that magical bards have reported experiencing some weeks ago, and the truth of it's cause and/or effects.

Sadly, they have been able to gather little information - only that the greater powers that be, such as the Guild of Adventures, do not know - or perhaps only refuse to share - any kind of actionable information regarding these incidents. In [[Yerba]], [[Sir Harris Bly]] and [[Toor, of Killskull]] - a Sergeant of [[Arthur's Knights]] and an affected Gnoll pitfighter - await your return, hoping to be briefed with valuable information - that you simply do not have.

What awaits you now, on the grand stone roads of the [[Iron Ward]] of [[Coalition City]], is a field of people who know nothing of you or your deeds and plots. They do not know the danger they calmly walk within. 

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?

1. The Black Blood Curse has been affecting everyone, and today (the {5}th of Plowing), the Council of Mages will be releasing a briefing to the Guilds en General.
2. Demon/Devil cults are being really fucking annoying, especially in the south-east and -west.
3. 

### What happened?
