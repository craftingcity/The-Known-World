Here lies a list of funny, interesting, or otherwise encounters set in the [[Underdark]].

# The Shallows' Caves
- An insidious 11th level human wizard and their trusty [Blood Golem](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/blood-golem/)
- A colony of [Blood Men](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/bloodman/)
- A colony of [Troglodyte]()
- A [Far Wanderer](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/far-wanderer/) leads the party to safety
- The party emerges into a spacious cavern, its walls glistening with gems. Inside a lone, wounded Svirfnebli prospector huddles tight to a sack of precious stones, refusing to part with them under any circumstance.
- The party enter into a wide-spanning cavern filled with stalagmites and stalactites, water drips in the distance. A patrol of Drow moves stealthily in the darkness, if they detect the party they engage at range, with the intent to incapacitate and enslave the party.
- The party encounters a deep pixie, an uncommon race of pixie that makes their home in the bowels of the Underdark. The pixie looks similar to a regular pixie, though the bright blue colouring and large, completely black eyes are still quite distinctive. The stat block for a deep pixie is identical to that of a regular pixie with the addition of darkvision out to 60 feet and the ability to speak undercommon. The deep pixie will vanish immediately upon being seen and will spend the next few hours pulling pranks and gently harassing the party. If they put up with it good-naturedly, the pixie will eventually feel guilty and stop. The pixie will then reveal themselves once more and investigate the good intentions of the party before inviting the party back to a mushroom town of other deep pixies. There the pixies will ensure proper recompense for whatever trouble the original pixie caused. After a time of rest spent there, the deep pixies send the party on its way with a full stock of supplies and knowledge of some of the local cavern shortcuts.
- Cloakers in equal number to the party ambush the party. Any cloaker that misses its first attack leaves the battle and hides out of reach. Any cloaker below half HP or forcibly detached will disengage and fly away to hide.
- The PCs stumble upon a small village that stretches along a ravine. If they inquire with the locals, they will find that the unfathomably dark chasm leads to a place they call "The Underdepths". The locals have to fight back horrible abyssal beasts every night, and each time it only gets worse.
- The party hears the clinking of hammers and pickaxes. Down a narrow corridor sits (d6-20, depends on level) undead duergar or dwarves. These poor souls have been cursed to mine the same section of rock for eternity. They look exhausted and will not interact with the party. If any of them are forcibly stopped from mining, they will attack the party. Any dwarves or duergar killed in this encounter will return in 24 hours and start mining. These creatures will appear to have made progress in the cavern over time but they have actually mined nothing
