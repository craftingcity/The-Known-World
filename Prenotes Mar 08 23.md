### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they met many of the most important spellcasters in [[Central Alaturmen]], the [[Guild of Wizards#Council of Mages]]. They found them lacking - in foresight, intelligence, or general wisdom - but nevertheless found their connections useful; they were met with the only being to ever return from a trip beyond [[Alaturmen]] - [[Eladrithal Greystone]], the famed Eladrin ranger of [[The Grey Ordeal]]. 

As the meeting disperses, and four of the five mages teleport away with a wave of their staves, the Blue Mage steps from its circle and walks between you all towards the exit back into the foyer of this room. Eladrithal, looking annoyed but compliant, follows the Mage out of the room.

As you leave the room to follow, the receptionist you met before - he who was mind-wiped - he presents you with papers to sign.

If they agree - which they likely should - they will be granted the following equipment upon the marrow;
