### Background
#### Adult Life
Fulton was born to a modest family that made their living raising sheep in the Grumbling Hills. When he was a youth, his herd and his family were destroyed when they got caught in the middle of a battle between the army of his Baron, Amethyst Jammu, and invading {?whose army?}. Under a pile of corpses, and fatally wounded, Fulton caught a glimpse of orange sunlight shining off of a Gish medallion dangling from a soldier's bloody neck. In desperation, as the sun set on what he thought would be his last day, he made a vow of vengeance - if he lived, he would thwart any army that committed war crimes like those his family were victims of. Gish, god of war, saw in him a potential champion of righteous and honor. He intervened with divine power to heal Fulton that he could crusade to rid Aliturmen of evildoers who would tarnish Gish's domain with dishonor and reproachful conduct. In the morning, Fulton was shocked to be alive. He immediately signed up as a volunteer in Baron Jammu's army so he could learn the art of warfare and gain the martial skills he would need to enact vengeance upon those who fight without honor, those who harm the innocent, and especially those who command their soldiers to do the same. During his time as a soldier, his lieutenant took to calling him "Shep", and when his tour was complete, he kept the name, feeling like he was a changed man. Perhaps Fulton did indeed die on that bloody field, resurrected as the Paladin he had become.
