### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were in a less than ideal position. In a land they don't know, with rules they do not understand, the party has quested beyond the material plane of Alaturmen seeking the deity known as Orcus. 

Since their arrival, they have created a small camp in the mountainside of the space they appeared into, fought two great beasts of hatred, slaying one and surviving the other. With little forward progress made, exploration seems to be the most pertinent course of action.

### What does the World Know?

I can pull on Moses because of his [[Marked By the Fire]] connection to [[Dis Pater, Orcus Avatar]].

[[Neranteen, the City of the Fishers]] and [[Kuta'a, the City of Miners]] are holding two avatars, the third of which is being hosted in [[Kalariel's Tower]]. Orcus proper, the actual Faith-born manifestation, sits in the [[Seat of the Dead]]

I can throw demons and devils at them, although canonically they are all Demons of Chaos rather than Devils of Evil, but the more interesting fauna would be the ghosts (who are now either miners or fishers or like, experiment fuel or just juice for Orcus in the [[Seat of the Dead]])

### What happened?
