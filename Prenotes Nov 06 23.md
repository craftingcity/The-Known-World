### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had made their way to the final recorded destination of the package you yourselves helped deliver. You arrived at the warehouse to find that the package has since moved, and according to a personal journal stored on-site, it was a group of Wheernat enforcers who took the package.

With as little information as you have, what is your next step?

### What does the World Know?

[[Wheernat Clan]] rules the [[Wheernat Hillkeep]].
