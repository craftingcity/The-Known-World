### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had returned to Alaturmen. Upon waking on the beaches of the Firelight Sea, you chartered passage to Coalition City, where Shu and Dae met with [[Nicolas Talaveem|the Yellow Mage]] and discussed their future. 

Approaching with caution and the intention to actually be paid for your work - especially given the circumstances of your hiring - you revealed only as much information as you needed to secure a meeting with the council as a whole, sometime during the 1st of Weeding.
