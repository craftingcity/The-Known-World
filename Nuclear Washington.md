A man answers the phone. He was asleep moments ago, but he can never afford to miss a call. The person on the other end of the line begins to speak. The man's expression sharpens from his dazed slumber, first into confusion, then realization, and defeat. He sits up from his bed.

"I understand."

He pours himself a drink. His ice has long melted, but his whisky will burn just as well all the same. He shakes his head, smiling at whatever he's being told.

"Ah, no. Thank you, but that won't be necessary. Yes. No, I will not. Be well, General."

The man ends the call. He grabs his drink, and stands from bed.
