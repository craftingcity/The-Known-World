### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had fought their way through and out of a prison of amber, and incidentally released it's intended captive; a young golden dragon. As the dragon flew west, you reasonably decided its escape was of no immediate threat to you, and you abandoned your now ruined delivery, and retreated to the small town of [[Veritas Garigill]], where after some minor rest and recuperation, we return to 'the Other Tavern', where we see the party planning their next moves...

### What does the World Know?

The ingame date is the 21st of Harvest, 106AF (07/21/106). I don't know *how* they're going to get this information, but I can know what information they are going to get.

#### The Company
- We have interests in [[The Democratic Combine of Peoples]] and [[The Old|Minyostalma]].
- We'd like to expand, absorbing or interacting with [[Cenva Minyo]] and the Noble Thieves of the Desert.
##### The Duties of the Three
- [[Slimknives]] are the bureaucratic powerhouse of SEASEC, in their proficiency in it's use or it's ignorance. Since the Conglomeration, we see less local field work, but that's fun.
- [[Riphounds]] are the physical powerhouse of SEASEC. We stand guard and look really mean (because we are) where we get told to. Getting told what to do really blows, but it's coming from the powers that be, and I don't want my ass kicked.
- [[Dampguard]] are the wealth powerhouse of SEASEC. You need us to move all your shit all over the place, and we're just as good at fighting as you.

##### The Fight in Mossburg & Grimace Coldsmile
- SEASEC has been eyeing Mossburg for some time, and we're doing an overt hostile takeover.
	- [[Grimace, the Coldsmile]], being a well-respected man-of-the-people, will help organize the civilian responses.
	- [[Hillkeep Loyalists]] & [[Knights in Red]] are fighting against us here.
	- [[Harvord Trading Company]] is, as always, trying to take a share it doesn't deserve.

##### The Utility Recruitment of Grovetenders
- SEASEC is a powerful fighting force, but getting a specialized science division would be very nice for long-term prosperity. So far, [[Grovetenders]] are the only ones who have show interest, likely due to their locational proximity to the [[Dampguard]].

#### The Dragon
##### The Dragons have Come!
- We saw a dragon coming from the Combine! We all did! Where did it come from?
	- Call the Council of Mages!
- More dragons will come, I swear! It came to me in a dream.

##### The Escape to Kailkeep
- [[Tymirek, the Unbound]] is flying towards [[Kailkeep]], where he seeks refuge for a while. He will likely find some, as he fights through the layers, and may return to the outside world after his experiences.

##### The Call to Tetrimoc
- We, the people of the Desert, call upon you [[Tetrimoc]] as our holy protector - banish the false gods from these lands and keep us safe in your light.

### What happened?


We leave our heroes on the date of ... AF, as they ...
