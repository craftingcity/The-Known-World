# Territories Economy
## As suggested by Grains into Gold
### Prelim
The area of the Hobgoblin Territories is largely forested. It is cold and rainy in this area. 

### "Bread"
Pemmican is a combination of powdered meat, fruit, and boiled fat. It lasts a long time, is cheap, and quite dense in nutrition.

### Food
What lives here?
#### Meat
The most common meat is game. Cattle is hard to manage in the denser parts of the forest, so Goats are a much more common farm animal. Goose and Duck are commonly kept as well, for their feathers, eggs, and meat.

#### Dairy
Goats milk and cheese are reasonably common, as are Goose and Duck egg. Some folks press nuts into dairy products as well, but this is a time consuming process that produces a less desirable product.

#### Grain
Wheat does not grow wild here, although Barley does. Acorns and Heartnut are reasonable replacements in breads, but Rye is preferable.

#### Fruit
Apple, Pear, and Berries grow in abundance in the dense forests of the area. Sweet and Hard drinks made from these fruits are the preferred drinks of the area, although Beer is produced as well.

#### Vegetable
Lettuces, Cabbage, Carrots, Potatoes grow well in the shade of the dense forests. Animals feed on grass and wild insects as well as grown vegetables as well.

#### Spice and Oil
Mint and Parsley grow well in the shade, as well as the common roots such as Garlic and Onion.

Beets grow wild in the deeper parts of the forest, and are almost always used as a sweetener either as whole or in sugar. Honey is as rare as beets, and just as about as hard to correctly harvest for its sweet juice.

Nut oils are made, but considered poor replacements for goat's butter. Rarely, good Oils from the City in Gold make their way into the territories and are highly valued.

#### Delicacy
Beef and Cow's dairy are highly prized, along with White flour products. Good oils and spices are hard to come by in this area.

### Vices
What do people do for *fun*?

### Land
Think about how people get their land, from who, and what features would there be?

### Overhead
What about taxes? Work animals? Buildings? Productions?

### Cutting Corners
How do people make ends meet? How do people value their luxuries?

### Middlemen
What does trade look like around here? What about guilds? Markets?

### Craftsmen
How are the craftsmen organized? Guild? How are they monitored / maintain their monopoly on knowledge? Who's in charge? How do they charge?

### Textiles
What sort of fabrics / leathers are available and acceptable? What about dyes?

### Preservation
What is being preserved, how, with what, in where? Are these methods suitable for the climate? How good is it? How do people get through winter? 

### Containers
What do people put stuff in? Do we show it or is it hidden? Can they be reused?

### Mining
What can be mined? How elaborate are the setups?

### Magic / Technology
Has magic influenced any of these things? What about Technology?
