# Grandey Hornswallow
## Young Bard
### he/him

> A young man, boyish in demeanor and speech, carries a banjo upon his back. At a reasonable 5'3", this human has much life ahead of him. 

Grandey is the purple eyed scrawny clumsy kawaii-boy bard that somehow Vix convinced to join her (yeah it was a nat20 and yeah i was a little tipsy).

He's seen enough to be considered a level one bard.

## Roleplaying
### "Oh boy sirs! I'd love to sing you a song!"


### Mannerism & Disposition

Nearly always cheerful and wonderous, Grandey can be used for comedic relief or as a genuine bait for those of us who care about him.

Grandey is quite naive, and will trust what most people say at face value.

### Background
#### Early Life

Born and raised in [[Wychway]], Grandey moved to [[Coalition City]] at a young age alongside his parents, Paulk and Raen Hornswallow, where he busked in a local tavern when there were no other performers.

After being contacted by the teifling adventurer, Vix of [[Koshachiy Domik]], Grandey wrote a letter of absence for his parents and joined their adventure north, beyond the barrier of the Wildlands. After receiving this letter, the boy has already gone, and after a number of days, a funeral is held privately for him by his parents and grandfather.
