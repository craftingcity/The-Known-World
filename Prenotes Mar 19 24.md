### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were deep within the heart of enemy territory - and they had a plan. With Alchemical Explosive, they would quickly disrupt and or destroy the Bloody Portal in [[Boneborn]]. 

Their plan was good, but no plan survives Celaena. She quickly appeared on the battlefield, summoning forth a horde of demons by her side. As you began to execute and adapt your plan - even while quick-witted - Ulfgar was executed by the Demon Princess. 

A simple moment. In the past he was alive. Now he is dead. The smile on his face as he fell to his knees was peaceful, even as he clutched his heart in pain. He died content. He was in the right place, in the right time. 

Nala quickly grabbed his hand and returned to the party, Jerran set off the explosive, and your Patron, the Archmage [[Alergra Barrowinch]], immediately teleported you from harms way.

You all land in Alergra's Quarters with the now familiar feeling of intense nausea churing upon your stomach. With haste, Alergra begins to cast a spell. A mote of blue flame flickers to life on her finger, and as she removes her finger - the mote begins to multiply. Quickly, these blue motes have created the image of Celaena with remarkable clarity. She stands at the ruins of the parade grounds, screaming into the skies. She quickly turns to look directly at you from the other side of the display, and the motes immediately dissipate.

"Well shit. Good work."
