### Goat Breathing Fire
The Goat Breathing Fire is a large tavern in Four Stone that brings patrons for its service and accoutrements, as well as its heritage as a house of board that caters to adventurers and dishonored travelers.

The late bard [[Paulo San Tymiq]] bought a table in the main room and carved his representation of the namesake of the tavern. That table remains unoccupied by regulars at the tavern, and those unaware are regaled if not harassed with the legends of the late [[Paulo San Tymiq]]
