### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were the victors of a teamfight in an Underground Fighting Concord match against four shmucks. They have recently been spending much of their time working directly as agents of the [[Guild of Wizards#Council of Mages]] in their War against [[Orcus]].

You know that you have a room at the Silver Unicorn within the [[Wheel Ward]] and a tentative meeting with [[Nicolas Talaveem]] tomorrow.

With that in mind, what do you do? (Are we just moving into the meeting?)
