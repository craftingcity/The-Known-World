### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they were victors in a teamfight in an Underground Fighting Concord match against four shmucks. With a minor monetary boon, they look to their most recent contacts in [[Guild of Wizards#Council of Mages]].

You know that you have a room at the Silver Unicorn within the [[Wheel Ward]] and a tentative meeting with [[Nicolas Talaveem]] tomorrow.

With that in mind, what do you do? (Are we just moving into the meeting?)

### What does the World Know?

The meeting occurs on the morning of the 2nd of Weeding. The council does not have a major-centralized goal. Nicolas would quest the party to investigate [[The Old|Minyostalma]], if they truly have nothing better to do.

[[Cenva Minyo]] has taken an interest in the party, especially given their relations with both the Council of Mages and the fact that they have returned from the Wildlands. At this time, they are not outright hostile to the party, but with any potential threat, Cenva Minyo would rather have Kal and/or the party gone than floating around the world.

Regarding any Demon Cults; they will fight the party as cultists and demonkin/undead united.
