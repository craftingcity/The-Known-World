### Intro
The world ended in 2012, and we just didn't know it yet. In late December, something happened in Kentucky - Louisville got bombed, and then quarantined. We couldn't do much from out here except pay our taxes and give our prayers. Then the quarantine broke, and the reality of what was happening there slowly started to materialize in the cultural conscience - it was really fucking bad, and it was spreading. 

By 2013, people were dying and not staying dead in Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia. Then the rest of the East Coast stopped responding. DC and New York are big ones. The stock exchange. The president. Turns out, a lot of what makes America tick is east of the Mississippi.

On July 20th, 2015, the United Nations announced their decision - over radio, so they knew we could hear - to release a barrage of warheads across the United States. They hit the East Coast sure, but they got the rest of us too. Rumor is they evacuated Mexico and Canada's borders only days before the bombs hit, but I don't believe that. It's been 30 days since. 

We don't know what's going on, even as close as Wenatchee
