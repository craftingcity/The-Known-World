### Intro

The world ended in 2012, and we just didn't know it yet. In late December, something happened in Kentucky - Louisville got bombed, and then quarantined. We couldn't do much from out here except pay our taxes and give our prayers. Then the quarantine broke, and the reality of what was happening there slowly started to materialize in the cultural conscience - it was really fucking bad, and it was spreading. 

By 2013, people were dying and not staying dead in Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia. Then the rest of the East Coast stopped responding. DC and New York are big ones. The stock exchange. The president. Turns out, a lot of what makes America tick is east of the Mississippi.

On July 20th, 2015, the United Nations announced their decision - over radio, so they knew we could hear - to release a barrage of warheads across the United States. They hit the East Coast sure, but they got the rest of us too. Rumor is they evacuated Mexico and Canada's borders only days before the bombs hit, but I don't believe that. It's been 30 days since. 

We don't know what's going on, we haven't heard much from the rest of the world since. We're on our own now.

So we stick together. Survive longer. Just make it through the day.

You survive in Burien, Old Burien specifically, for now. A group of some 20 survivors has gathered in the St Elizabeth Church, scavenging the area to the best of their ability. You are among them. You are led by a pastor, Father Gonzalez, who has organized the group, given them goals, tasks, and a relatively safe and normative space to survive within. 

The Father comes to you with a request. "I need your help. I need your guns. Go north, up to St. Bernadette's. Tell Father Patrick we survive, and take him this. He will have one for you to take back. Come home safe, for our sake."

He hands you a list of names. We trek unto Seattle.
