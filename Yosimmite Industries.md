# Yosimmite Industries
## History
The Yosimmite Industries were founded in 074AF as a general metallurgic product manufacturer, and spent the first dozen years of business in this regard. As Durandurm came into the economy of the south, [[Blackrock Yosimmite]] began to transform his commercially focused production into a militaristic production, making Durandurm fueled cannons, throwers, and eventually the first genuine 'firearm'.
