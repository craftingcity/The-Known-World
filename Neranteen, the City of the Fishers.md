#### the City of the Fishers
## Holding of [[Orcus]]
### Located in [[Thanatos]], X:Y
## Description
### "Where some mine, we fish. It's honest work."

The "city" for lack of a better term is a large collection of apartment housings and office workplaces. Neither of these are necessary, but they are both often occupied. The main street has an offshoot to the "east-south-east" that leads to the "fishing communities" where these ghosts hunt for deformed soul matter in the murk to appease the servants of [[Orcus]].

For the "nobility", as much as the demonkin could be called that, this place is important only as the seat of power for [[Dis Pater, Orcus Avatar]]. Those who he rules support a project in the center of the city, far from the [[Ancoris Templum]]

### General Public Disposition

The population here are all miserable. 

This place is an attempt at law in a land of horrible chaos. 

> "When demons come, or while they reside here, as they often do, we fight each other for things we don't need, for food we don't eat."


### Background

vibe set for [[Cathouse Game]] in [[Thanatos]], 

## Important Places & Symbolism

[[Dis Pater, Orcus Avatar]] is the top dog around here.
