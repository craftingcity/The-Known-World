> This creature is more beast than man. While it stands before you with two arms and two legs, it is furred upon its limbs and hooved upon it's legs - it is a buking mass of gross muscle. Silhouetting two thick-hide wings, a head of a skinless boar smiles and snorts as it notices you. 

One of three minibosses that are supporting specific cults in the material plane of [[Alaturmen]].
