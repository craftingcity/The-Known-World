### Intro

When last we left our heroes they were performing business and work in [[Coalition City]]; most importantly, they have been dealing with the Council of Mages, attempting to secure a valuable reward in exchange for their recovered captive - Kalariel.

An old friend by the name of Moses has offered a sum of five-hundred-thousand silver in the form of platinum coinage (5000p), but the group tentatively declined, awaiting a quoted figure from the Council or perhaps even other interested parties.

With your meeting set for tomorrow, sometime during the upcoming festival to celebrate Newmonth, I put the question to you; what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

The Wizards can offer "the Party" a BoI nearly anywhere in the world, a gold-star stamp on their record, and a series of IOUs for magical items created either by master enchanters or the wizards themselves.

Moses will come back with a larger sum of money, 7500p, but will attempt to purchase the captive at-quote or slightly above before resorting to violence.

If able, a squad of [[Cenva Minyo]] soldiers will take Kalariel for their own, and extract him northward.
