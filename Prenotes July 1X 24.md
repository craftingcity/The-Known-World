### Intro

When last we left our hero, they had officially joined up with the Delta 3 Mercenary Squad and accompannied them into the depths of Minyostalma. The goal of the operation is simple - Kill On Sight. Your targets are located in the City's Mall structure, a grand and hazardous building that reaches up into the sky.

Your party has made its way through the Construction Site, taking minor damage as they progressed into the Mall, where they now stand. You hear the creaking of metal. You see the dust in the air. You smell death. 

Nail has clearly decorated this place with the intention of scaring off those who would be on the fence regarding facing him - including skullspikes, bloodspattered walls, and chalked messages of intimidation and warning. 

You are not on the fence. You are here to do a job. Killing Nail is what you are here to do.
