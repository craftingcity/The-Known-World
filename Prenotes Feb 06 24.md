### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had navigated themselves and their three freshly equipped orphan adventurers beyond many of the traps and tricks of your first layer in Kailkeep's Hells. Upon ascending the stairs, you were greeted with a small lobby - with a locked door. You agreed to play whatever game would come next against another three "players".

Your game is Four Corners. You can all recall playground games with the same name, but the rules are still left unexplained - so too are the presence of the blind dogs released into your playing field.

"Welcome to Four~ Corners!~ Today's teams include; Jonah's Honorable Thieves... The 'Vulture's Talons'... Bloodylip's Pack... and the Hatdroppers!"
