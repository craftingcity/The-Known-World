### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had suffered severe losses. During the assault on White Tower in [[Kamarios]], they made progress on their goal when they encountered the Black Mage, [[Qiell Tilemundon]], in his bed chambers. 

His response resulted in his death, for the first time. You handily defeated him, within his own lair to boot. But something was wrong. His machines began to boil, and a living corpse walked forth, the body of Kalariel with the mind of Qiell. 

He was horrible. He moved too fast. He ripped flesh with his hands as he confidently floated himself out of the building. He reduced Shu Ameda to a fine ash in his moment of heroism. 

His escape would have Cucu disappear alongside him. In the minutes that followed, she was cast into a cold black nothing. It felt like an eternity. And then it was over, and she was shunted back into the light, bright and warm, she falls to the dirt where she stood as a giant ape only a minute before.

The townsfolk have taken notice of you. Hushed words and pointed fingers arrive in your direction. What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
The biggest world events in the week of 15th include the meeting of [[Jorrin Bearscarred]] and [[Arthur Simonson]], the fall of [[Beacon]] and the South-East of the Combine, and the to-be Communicae of the Coalition's representatives.

The Wizards of the Council of Mages will all be unable to attend - excepting [[The Wizard In Blue]], who has yet to leave [[Coalition City]] and will be present. [[Alergra Barrowinch]] is making personal preparations for combating [[Hannah's Demon (Celaena)]] alongside [[Sarahouse Game|The Hatdroppers]]. [[Nicolas Talaveem]] and [[Pirre Tald]] have returned to their towers before they will set off for [[Kamarios]] in an attempt to recognize what [[Qiell Tilemundon]] is doing; becoming a lich.

[[Kaliqeill, Lich of Orcus]] departed to his tower in [[Thanatos]], where he will gather strength and ingredients before returning to conquer [[Coalition City]]. He Banished Cucu after marking her with a Hex.

The [[Golden Claws]] have been vigorously defended [[The Golden City]] and [[Tetrimoc's Blessings]] from both roaming nomads and thief raids, leaving [[Kickoff]] to become more and more influenced by the Thieves of the desert.

The Church's armies in [[Yagil]] and [[Odaya]] have been formally mobilized to find and eliminate opposing forces in [[Littetavarse]]; the [[First Crusade of the Fire's Will]].
