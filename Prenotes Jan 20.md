### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they had arrived at their destination. With as little help as you could take from your agent-guides, you found yourselves in the presence of [[Baron Avory]] in the lavishly adorned back-room of a smoke-shop in [[Amourain]]. 

In conversation with the Baron, her goals became less opaque; she requires Daelith's presence for an exclusive ritual to take place some time in the future. How she decided that it was Daelith that was required, or what exactly she would be doing in this ritual was not revealed.

With what little information they were given, your party was waved off, but Vix - with a very reasonable measure of suspicion for the situation - demanded to stay with Daelith, by her side, up to or perhaps even during this mysterious ritual. From one hollow woman to another, this favor was granted, and the three of you - Daelith, Vix, and Baron Avory herself - began what you might consider... a side-quest.



You travelled for two days in a caravan of fine carts, each of which was guarded by at least four armed and armored guards at all times. During the day, yourselves and the Baron travelled together, and the other two carts in your caravan were left empty. 

During the first night, the Baron kindly showed the sleeping arrangements in your cart and departed for her own. Your doors were locked, and your cart was continually guarded, still. On the second night, you did not make a camp for the night, and continued your travel to your destination - the now visible and glowing city of [[Beacon]]. 

You travelled deep into the city before halting on the street and entering a building visibly titled "Chased Hare Tavern & Inn". As you and your parade enter the building, you are pointed up the stairs where master suite rooms have been prepared for the both of you, including a hot-stone bath-tub, a large warmed bed, and a large selection of desserts and breakfast pastries.
