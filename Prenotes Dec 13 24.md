### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had arrived in Coalition City to deliver a collection of fake packages in an attempt to disguise your murderous burglary of your own caravan. You all arrived early, however, and have decided to pursue information and equipment that will further fuel your adventures.

After a full-party trip to 'The Arms Dealer', the majority of you have travelled to the Center of Arcane Education, also known as the Library, on the hunt for personally important information. Sadly, the information you're after isn't available to the public. It's 'restricted', but you've been directed to the third floor's western wing, where you quickly found a set of doors simply labeled "Restricted Demonology".

What do you do?

### What does the World Know?
##### The Library
Much of the content that the party is really interested in is 'restricted', meaning that the party needs to do *something* to gain access, such as sign up as a Guilded Party, have a student or faculty gather the requested materials, or try to break the magical protections that the Arcane Center of Education keeps on it's Library.

##### The Delivery
The [[Northstone Family Trading Company]] has a depot in the [[Wheel Ward]] of [[Coalition City]], where they expect a number of carts, but the one our party delivers is notably suspect, - missing a manifest and a driver, and carrying goods that are explicitly not ours to transport - something has gone wrong. Divinatory investigation would reveal that it was our party and not an outside influence that borked this job.
