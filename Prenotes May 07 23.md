### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had travelled again across the known world, from the major city of [[Magius]] south-west, again, though not into the Golden City but beyond it. Using incomplete information and your survivalist skills, you were able to locate your quarry; a temple built deep within the hills of [[Lord's Folly]].
