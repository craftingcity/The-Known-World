### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had travelled again across the known world, from the major city of [[Magius]] south-west, again, though not into the Golden City but beyond it. Using incomplete information and your survivalist skills, you were able to locate your quarry; a temple built deep within the hills of [[Lord's Folly]]. It is supposed that the purpose of this temple relates somehow to [[Gail Thomas]] and the extraplanar known as [[Orcus]]. 

As the sun rises in the east, alighting the globe atop the Golden City barely visible in the horizon, you and your idle mounts reawaken. From your camp upon the dunes, you can keep a line of sight to the temple, itself an ugly thing. Built of red sandstone, the building itself is bulbus and pudgy, it's columns overflowing with smooth rock.

### What does the World Know?

We are entering [[Lord's Folly#AE2. Temple to Hades]]. We have a few different teams in the mix for this dungeon; 

First, the 6 noble thieves. 4 from Cobalt's group () and 2 from Agrandica's - they are working together for the time being in search of any signs of [[Ranger's Guild]] patrols in the area.
