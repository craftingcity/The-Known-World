### Intro

When we last left our heroes, they were traveling along a well-maintained cobblestone path, southward, toward the interior of the mountains. [[Coalition City]], the party's goal-apparent for the gathering of information, lies in the center of the massive [[Deakred Range]]. 

The sun is no longer visible behind the massive red mountains. Although it still alights the sky a bright blue, it will begin to dim within the hour.
