Okay. I need some stuff for travelling in the underdark, a list to pull from or roll on for the in-between of the locations in my head. I have some locations on paper, but its all pencil.

So. Objectives?

On Travel:
- structure
- biome
- size

On "Tick (ie once a day right? rations, long rests, )"
- does encounter happen?
- encounters table of description (good, neut., bad roll -> other table, sound & light carry; this is a saved roll, we get to know whats next, but not necessarily when^^. is this based on the biome where in? probably. high biome diversity -> low threat diversity? lets hope not)
