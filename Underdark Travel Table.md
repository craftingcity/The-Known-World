Okay. I need some stuff for travelling in the underdark, a list to pull from or roll on for the in-between of the locations in my head. I have some locations on paper, but its all pencil.

So. Objectives?

On Travel:
- structure
- biome
	- hunting / gathering potency?
- size


Record entries from this table onto a sheet or page. Some results may be best represented as a "backtrack" as for m
# Tables on Travel
## Entering a New Space

1d6 | for a size of space
--- | ---
1 | tiny, half a day's travel
2 | small, less than a day's travel
3 | medium, more that a day of travel
4 | large, many days of travel
5 | huge, a week or more of travel
6 | gigantic, multiple weeks of travel

1dx | for a type of space | and maybe a description or a [link](https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/underdark/exploring.shtml)
--- | --- | ---
1 | An Abyss | "Vast, empty voids of awesome scope". See [[#Abysses]]
2 | A Cave | See [[#Caves]]
3 | A Dungeon | See [[#Dungones]] and then search for "Undermountain" or sometin
4 | A Gorge | See [[#Gorges]]
5 | A Lake

1d4 | for a potency of foodsources
--- | --- 
1 | No food can be found in this place
2 | Very poor food for you can be found in this place (poisoned berries and the like)
3 | Some food for you can be found in this place
4 | It is easy to find food for you in this place

On "Tick (ie once a day right? rations, long rests)"
- does encounter happen?
- encounters table of description (good, neut., bad roll -> other table, sound & light carry; this is a saved roll, we get to know whats next, but not necessarily when^^. is this based on the biome where in? probably. high biome diversity -> low threat diversity? lets hope not)

#### Abysses

Vast, empty voids of awesome scope, the Underdark's abysses are rare features that can form insuperable barriers to travel. An abyss is simply a great open space, sometimes many dozens of miles in breadth and virtually bottomless. Some Underdark abysses are scores of miles deep. The difference between an abyss and a vault is difficult to define, but as a general rule, a vast space approachable from its higher reaches is an abyss, while the same space approachable from the floor might be better described as a vault. Abysses tend to be larger and deeper than areas that are considered vaults, but this is not always the case.

Like the starkest mountains of the Lands Above, abysses are often completely impassable to anything without wings. Underdark civilizations near such features sometimes carve out harrowing ledge-paths to circle the tremendous void of the neighboring abyss, or endless stairs to descend its walls.

#### Caves
**Cavern**: A large chamber in a cave.

**Dead Cave or Dry Cave**: A cave without running streams, lakes, or drips of water.

**Gallery**: A large, mostly horizontal chamber.

**Lake**: A standing body of water of any size. What upperworlders might call a puddle may be a lake in the Underdark.

**Live Cave or Wet Cave**: A cave with flowing water or a lake.

**Maze Cave**: Several passages and chambers interconnected, often on two or more levels.

**Ossuary**: A cave filled with bones. If the bones are fossils, the cave is often called a fossil chamber.

**Spring**: A natural upwelling of water from rock or soil. Few springs offer drinkable water; the majority of them are laden with harmful substances.

Perhaps the most common topographical feature of the Underdark, a cave system consists of a series of caverns and passages that may stretch for miles. Caves can be forme by several different methods, but the most common is the action of flowing water. Cave systems often twist, turn, climb, and drop in a maddening fashion, forming three-dimensional mazes that dishearten even the most determined mapmakers.

Caves vary widely in terms of their habitability. Living caves that include streams or rivers are full of life (by Underdark standards) and can often support surprisingly large populations, especially of improbably large and ferocious monsters. Other caves may be barren wastelands, without food or water.
