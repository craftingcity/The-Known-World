Okay. I need some stuff for travelling in the underdark, a list to pull from or roll on for the in-between of the locations in my head. I have some locations on paper, but its all pencil.

So. Objectives?

- terrain (changes, length, etc.)
- encounters (good, neut., bad roll -> other table, sound & light carry; is this a daily roll?)
