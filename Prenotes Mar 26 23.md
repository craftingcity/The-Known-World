### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had spoken with [[Alergra Barrowinch]] about their next moves, and she suggested seeking more information in the ruins of the temple mentioned in the legendary [[The Ballad of Grey Ordeal]], located somewhere within the [[Lord's Folly]] of [[The Deserts of Tetrimoc]].

### What does the World Know?

i really wish i preped more for this one - we're probably gonna travel, search for the temple, and maybe get into it?
