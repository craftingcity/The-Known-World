### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had survived an attack by a patrol of vulture-esq creatures on their way into the one city they know of in this area. For one reason or another, the group has decided to split into two groups of 4 - yourselves, grouping together. Moses - your communion with the entity you have discovered within yourself has given you the knowledge that you would make progress by continuing into the city ahead. I ask you now, with your companions behind you, what do you do?

### What does the World Know?

jack shit

moses has a mark and pull towards [[Dis Pater, Orcus Avatar]]

### What happened?

they headed deeper into the city

> Giant gorilla eating ghost people, used spell to get through, go around or dont go. Wizards are corrupt, fuck this place, we are leaving, ttyl

they head beyond the city after sending Grande's message in search of the "bridge that will take us beyond here" - they are pretty pissed at the Wizards for sending them here without like, any information. 

the only thing that we'll need from the party is a set of coins each for [[Karenos, River's Keeper]] to transport them back home.
