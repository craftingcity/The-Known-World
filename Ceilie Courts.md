The Ceilie Courts are the fey courts that "organize" the feywild. They are ruled by four individual Seasonal Monarchs. These monarchs impose their order on their subjects. Seasonal Fey in the courts ar hardpressed to find reception from Seasonal Fey outside their season. Non-Seasonal fey do not have this issue, and work with many monarchs and members of the courts semi-freely.
