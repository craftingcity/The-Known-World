# intention
It is my intention to hack the current 5e system of HP, Hit Die, AC, and Death Saves as a complete representation of a character's "health" into something akin to VtM's "superficial wounds" & "mortal wounds", that also maybe lets me play with higher damages for my "normal" weapons

# Vitality
A character's ability to "tank", dodge, parry, block, evade, or otherwise *not fully ef'n die from* (because remember, that's the goal when you swing a sword at someone or shoot a fire bolt at their dome) is known as their Vitality. This is equal to the maximum possible roll on a charachter's combined Hit Die (we're keeping this system, I *really* like it, but it should actually matter outside of the one og5e short rest you take before you sleep - interrupting long rests are a fine way to go, but its REALLY fucking annoying to do this or have this done on either side of the table).

For example, my party is composed of a barbarian, Jessup, a ranger, Folyian, a cleric, Meshueicyn, and a wizard, Barrug. We are level five, so we each have five hit die; we also know that our maximum vitality is a multiple of five, because we are fifth level.

Jessup, being a barbarian, has the largest Hit Die in the game, the d12. His maximum Vitality is 60.

Again, Jessup, being a barbarian, is often resistant to "weapon" damage types, and therefore *could* be argued to have an effective maximum Vitality of 120. Wow.

Folyian is our ranger, and Meshueicyn is our cleric. Both these classes have a Hit Die of a d8. They have a maximum Vitality of 40. Okay, we should try to stay behind our barbarian, they're going to have 3x our Vitality most of the time.

Barrug is our wizard. Wizards have a Hit Die of a d6. At level five, Barrug has a maximum vitality of 30. 

Great! Now we've gone adventuring a bunch and we all survived and we leveled up a bunch. Now we're level 15!

Jessup has a MV of 180 (or ~360, if you subscribe to that ideology)
