# intention
It is my intention to hack the current 5e system of HP, Hit Die, AC, and Death Saves as a complete representation of a character's "health" into something akin to VtM's "superficial wounds" & "mortal wounds", that also maybe lets me play with higher damages for my "normal" weapons

# Vitality
A character's ability to "tank", dodge, parry, block, evade, or otherwise *not fully ef'n die from* (because remember, that's the goal when you swing a sword at someone or shoot a fire bolt at their dome) is known as their Vitality. This is equal to a character's maximum roll on a single Hit Die (we're keeping this system, I *really* like it, but it should actually matter outside of the one og5e short rest you take before you sleep - interrupting long rests are a fine way to go, but its REALLY fucking annoying to do this or have this done on either side of the table) plus their constitution modifier, times their level.

> ``V = 1HD+CON*LVL``

For example, my party is composed of 4 characters who all have a CON mod of 0; a barbarian, Jessup, a ranger, Folyian, a cleric, Meshueicyn, and a wizard, Barrug. We are level five, so we each have five hit die; we also know that our maximum vitality is a multiple of five, because we are fifth level and all have a +0 CON.

Jessup, being a barbarian, has the largest Hit Die in the game, the d12. His maximum Vitality is 60. 

Again, Jessup, being a barbarian, is often resistant to "weapon" damage types, and therefore *could* be argued to have an effective maximum Vitality of 120. Wow.

Folyian is our ranger, and Meshueicyn is our cleric. Both these classes have a Hit Die of a d8. They have a maximum Vitality of 40. Okay, we should try to stay behind our barbarian, they're going to have 3x our Vitality most of the time.

Barrug is our wizard. Wizards have a Hit Die of a d6. At level five, Barrug has a maximum vitality of 30. 

Great! Now we've gone adventuring a bunch and we all survived and we leveled up a bunch. Now we're level 15!

Jessup has a MV of 180 (or ~360, when raging), Folyian and Meshueicyn have a MV of 120, and Barrug has a MV of 90.

When compared to a og5e party, we look pretty tough (dont we?), and don't get it twisted, we are. We'd fuck em up for sure, I think.

Imagine if any of us had a positive CON mod.
Or a **negative** one...

# Mortal Wounds
A character can endure a number of mortal wounds equal to their constitution modifier. 

When a character takes "damage" that would push them below 0 vitality, they immediately take a Mortal Wound. 

> If a character reaches exactly 0 Vitality, god-damn that's sick. They will now take one MW per Attack they are hit with

After a character has been exposed to a mortal wound, they may immediately spend a number of hit die equal to their constitution modifier. 

> If their modifier is 0, or negative, it sure sucks to suck don't it, seems to me, you should have stayed in the fucking *library*, not the battlefield! ***Pwned~***!

## Death Call
When a character has endured as many mortal wounds as they can, at the beginning of their turn, they make a Death Call. Roll a d20. Add nothing, other than your prayers to the Fates and Ar'Kraven. 

If the roll is a ten or higher, you succeed, and you live for the next six seconds. Otherwise, you fail, and take one point of exhaustion.

If a character takes a mortal wound, and they can endure no more, they immediately die, no Death Call required.
