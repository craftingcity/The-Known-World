# intention
It is my intention to hack the current 5e system of HP, Hit Die, AC, and Death Saves as a complete representation of a character's "health" into something akin to VtM's "superficial wounds" & "mortal wounds", that also maybe lets me play with higher damages for my "normal" weapons

# Vitality
A character's ability to "tank", dodge, parry, block, evade, or otherwise *not die from* (because remember, thats the goal when you swing a fucking sword at someone or shoot a fire bolt at their dome)
