### Intro
When we last left our heroes, after must shenanaganary, they had made their way into the town of Yerba. In its outskirts, Nala was disguised as a Red Dragonborn in an attempt to cover tracks before they are sought after and Jerren met with an old friend in Kirin of Kirin's Stables and procured ==some number of horses==. Breenabelle led the party deeper into the city, to the [[Dragon Blood Inn]] to stay for the night. There the party met with the (orcish) patron of the establishment Nico Bennett, procured room and board for the night, and learned of a secret underground fighting collective that gathers in the basement of this very Inn.

### What does the World Know?
[[Alisinder Rancarlo]] is awaiting the arrival of "a band of unusual carriers" to pick up the Archmage's package.

Bets for fights are handled by Paul the Shady Elf, a now old spring elf.
