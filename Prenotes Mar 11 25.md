### Intro

When last we left our heroes, they had made their way into [[Forgehome]] and the good graces of a dwarf living and mining in the city - Minora - who would take you on an expedition where you made contact with a creature known as an Illithid, and made bank selling mithril. 

Minora has since returned from her shopping trip, where she procured a wide array of magically emboldening trinkets upon your request, and has provided the remainder of your share as coinage.

Wealthy, powerful, and successful - what would you like to do?

### What does the World Know?
i dont know, fuck...

I think they're probably going to go down to the Illithid? Like I think that is the only thing they have a "reason" to do, go down, towards Deepreach and the Elder Brain.



### What happened?
They want to come down! Yay!
