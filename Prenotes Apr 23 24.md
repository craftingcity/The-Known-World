### Intro
When last we left our heroes, they were recuperating and resting within the Archmage [[Alergra Barrowinch]]'s Tower in [[Magius University]], preparing for another engagement with Celaena.

You know that she commands her armies from the bunker once home to the [[Baron Xuiop]] of [[Boneborn]], and while her troops have begun to reach for the western Combine, you are certain that you will find her in the city she first claimed.
