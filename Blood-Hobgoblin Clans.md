# Blood-Hobgoblin Clans
## History
The Blood-Hobgoblin Clans were formed when many families of hobgoblin ratified the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]], declared themselves an ethno-state and won their independence from the [[Bandit Lords]] and [[The Kingdom of Prosper]]. 

They now occupy the [[Illburn Forest]] to the northeast of [[Arthur's Prairie]].

## Governance
The Clans are all independent, and govern themselves as they wish for the most part, but they all follow the [[Blood-Hobgoblin Clan Pact]], including structure and the like.
